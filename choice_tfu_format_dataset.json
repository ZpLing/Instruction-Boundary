    "Facts": "Background: Sent 1: Alexander married twice: Roxana, daughter of the Bactrian nobleman Oxyartes, out of love; and Stateira II, a Persian princess and daughter of Darius III of Persia, for political reasons.Sent 2: He apparently had two sons, Alexander IV of Macedon of Roxana and, possibly, Heracles of Macedon from his mistress Barsine.Sent 3: He lost another child when Roxana miscarried at Babylon.Sent 4: Alexander also had a close relationship with his friend, general, and bodyguard Hephaestion, the son of a Macedonian noble.Sent 5: Hephaestion's death devastated Alexander.Sent 6: This event may have contributed to Alexander's failing health and detached mental state during his final months.Sent 7: Alexander's sexuality has been the subject of speculation and controversy.Sent 8: No ancient sources stated that Alexander had homosexual relationships, or that Alexander's relationship with Hephaestion was sexual.Sent 9: Aelian, however, writes of Alexander's visit to Troy where \"Alexander garlanded the tomb of Achilles and Hephaestion that of Patroclus, the latter riddling that he was a beloved of Alexander, in just the same way as Patroclus was of Achilles\".Sent 10: Noting that the word eromenos (ancient Greek for beloved) does not necessarily bear sexual meaning, Alexander may have been bisexual, which in his time was not controversial.Sent 11: Green argues that there is little evidence in ancient sources that Alexander had much carnal interest in women; he did not produce an heir until the very end of his life.Sent 12: However, he was relatively young when he died, and Ogden suggests that Alexander's matrimonial record is more impressive than his father's at the same age.Sent 13: Apart from wives, Alexander had many more female companions.Sent 14: Alexander accumulated a harem in the style of Persian kings, but he used it rather sparingly; showing great self-control in \"pleasures of the body\".Sent 15: Nevertheless, Plutarch described how Alexander was infatuated by Roxana while complimenting him on not forcing himself on her.Sent 16: Green suggested that, in the context of the period, Alexander formed quite strong friendships with women, including Ada of Caria, who adopted him, and even Darius's mother Sisygambis, who supposedly died from grief upon hearing of Alexander's death.\nOptions:\n0.

    "Facts": "Background: Sent 1: His exile lasted nearly a year and a half.Sent 2: Long before that time there had come a reaction in his favour.Sent 3: The new consuls were well disposed towards him; Clodius's insolence had already disgusted Pompey; Caesar was absent with his legions in Gaul; his own friends, who had all along been active in his favour (though in his querulous mood he accused them of apathy) took advantage of the change, his generous rival Hortensius being amongst the most active; and all the frantic violence of Clodius and his party served only to delay for a while the return which they could not prevent.Sent 4: A motion for his recall was carried at last by an immense majority.Sent 5: Cicero had one remarkable ally on that occasion.Sent 6: On one of the days when the Senate was known to be discussing his recall, the 'Andromache' of Ennius was being played in the theatre.Sent 7: The popular actor Esop, whose name has come down to us in conjunction with that of Roscius, was playing the principal character.Sent 8: The great orator had been his pupil, and was evidently regarded by him as a personal friend.Sent 9: With all the force of his consummate art, he threw into Andromache's lament for her absent father his own feelings for Cicero.Sent 10: The words in the part were strikingly appropriate, and he did not hesitate to insert a phrase or two of his own when he came to speak of the man\nOptions:\n0.

    "Facts": "Background: Sent 1: Hundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the world's longest-running civilization, the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire.Sent 2: Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire.Sent 3: We might call it the first Chinese invention.Sent 4: Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire.Sent 5: Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight.Sent 6: He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat.Sent 7: Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued.Sent 8: And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down.Sent 9: Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology.Sent 10: The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel.Sent 11: Europeans did not yet have a word for \"coal,\" nor had they discovered a use for it.Sent 12: The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty.Sent 13: This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees.Sent 14: And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars.Sent 15: During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art.Sent 16: Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements.Sent 17: And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago.Sent 18: The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government.\nOptions:\n0.

    "Conclusion": "Was Tocqueville interested in control over all of Algeria? If not, what parts did he want to control?",
    "Facts": "Background: Sent 1: In his 1847 Report on Algeria, Tocqueville declared that Europe should avoid making the same mistake they made with the European colonization of the Americas in order to avoid the bloody consequences.Sent 2: More particularly he reminds his countrymen of a solemn caution whereby he warns them that if the methods used towards the Algerian people remain unchanged, colonization will end in a blood bath.Sent 3: Tocqueville includes in his report on Algeria that the fate of their soldiers and finances depended on how the French government treats the various native populations of Algeria, including the various Arab tribes, independent Kabyles living in the Atlas Mountains, and the powerful political leader Abd-el-Kader.Sent 4: In his various letters and essays on Algeria, Tocqueville discusses contrasting strategies by which a European country can approach imperialism.Sent 5: In particular, the author differentiates between what he terms 'dominance' and a particular version of 'colonization'.Sent 6: The latter stresses the obtainment and protection of land and passageways that promise commercial wealth.Sent 7: In the case of Algeria, the Port of Algiers, and the control over the Strait of Gibraltar, were considered by Tocqueville to be particular valuable.Sent 8: Direct control of the political operations of the entirety of Algeria, however, was not.Sent 9: Thus the author stresses domination over only certain points of political influence as a means to colonization of commercially valuable areas.Sent 10: Tocqueville argued that domination via violent means, though unpleasant, is necessary for colonization and justified by the laws of war.Sent 11: Such laws are not discussed in detail; however, given that the goal of the French mission in Algeria was to obtain commercial and military interest as opposed to self-defense, it can be deduced that Tocqueville would not concur with Just war theory's jus ad bellum criteria of just cause.Sent 12: Further, given that Tocqueville approved of the use of force to eliminate civilian housing in enemy territory, his approach does not accord with Just War Theory's jus in bellow criteria of proportionality and discrimination.\nOptions:\n0.

    "Facts": "Background: Sent 1: According to the radar reconstruction, American 77 reemerged as a primary target on Indianapolis Center radar scopes at 9:05, east of its last known position.Sent 2: The target remained in Indianapolis Center's airspace for another six minutes, then crossed into the western portion of Washington Center's airspace at 9:10.Sent 3: As Indianapolis Center continued searching for the aircraft, two managers and the controller responsible for American 77 looked to the west and southwest along the flight's projected path, not east-where the aircraft was now heading.Sent 4: Managers did not instruct other controllers at Indianapolis Center to turn on their primary radar coverage to join in the search for American 77.Sent 5: In sum, Indianapolis Center never saw Flight 77 turn around.Sent 6: By the time it reappeared in primary radar coverage, controllers had either stopped looking for the aircraft because they thought it had crashed or were looking toward the west.Sent 7: Although the Command Center learned Flight 77 was missing, neither it nor FAA headquarters issued an all points bulletin to surrounding centers to search for primary radar targets.Sent 8: American 77 traveled undetected for 36 minutes on a course heading due east for Washington, D.C. By 9:25, FAA's Herndon Command Center and FAA headquarters knew two aircraft had crashed into the World Trade Center.Sent 9: They knew American 77 was lost.Sent 10: At least some FAA officials in Boston Center and the New England Region knew that a hijacker on board American 11 had said \"we have some planes.\"Sent 11: Concerns over the safety of other aircraft began to mount.Sent 12: A manager at the Herndon Command Center asked FAA headquarters if they wanted to order a \"nationwide ground stop.\"Sent 13: While this was being discussed by executives at FAA headquarters, the Command Center ordered one at 9:25.Sent 14: The Command Center kept looking for American 77.Sent 15: At 9:21, it advised the Dulles terminal control facility, and Dulles urged its controllers to look for primary targets.Sent 16: At 9:32, they found one.Sent 17: Several of the Dulles controllers \"observed a primary radar target tracking eastbound at a high rate of speed\" and notified Reagan National Airport.Sent 18: FAA personnel at both Reagan National and Dulles airports notified the Secret Service.\nOptions:\n0.

    "Facts": "Background: Sent 1: Though prehistoric remains from the Paleolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Ages have been unearthed in the Manzanares Valley, prior to Madrid's sudden elevation to capital city in 1561 its history was rather undistinguished.Sent 2: Over a period of many centuries crucial in Spanish history, Madrid's significance was negligible.Sent 3: The Romans built their most advanced outpost on the Iberian peninsula, but left nothing of consequence in Madrid.Sent 4: Armies of North African nomads, intent on disseminating Islam, invaded the peninsula in a.d.Sent 5: Within 10 years, they had overrun most of Spain.Sent 6: If Madrid played any role in these pivotal events, no record of it remains.Sent 7: The first solid references to this obscure settlement on the Castilian plateau, guarded by the looming Guadarrama mountain range, appear in the 9th century.Sent 8: The Arabic name for \"place of many springs,\" variously recorded as Magerit, Mayrit or Magrit, eventually evolved into Madrid.Sent 9: The hamlet entered historical chronicles for its military significance; it was located near the main line of resistance to the Christian reconquest.Sent 10: Over centuries of struggle, the defending Moorish army built a full-scale fort, or Alcázar, on the heights of Madrid commanding the Manzanares valley.Sent 11: After several unsuccessful skirmishes, the Christian forces of Alfonso VI captured Madrid in 1083.Sent 12: The Alcázar became a fort of the crown of Castile.Sent 13: During a counter-offensive in 1109, the town was overrun by the Moors, but the Christianized fortress held.Sent 14: The Moors were expelled from the town, but they remained in control of southern Spain for almost four centuries.Sent 15: Meanwhile, Madrid enjoyed brief prominence in 1308 when king Ferdinand IV and his Cortes, an early version of parliament, held a formal meeting in the fledgling town.Sent 16: From then on, the kings of Spain began to visit Madrid, where the air was invigorating and the hunting excellent.Sent 17: Ferdinand and Isabella, the Catholic monarchs that united all the provinces of Spain, first visited Madrid in 1477.\nOptions:\n0.

F. Skinner, Sigmund Freud, and Jean Piaget, and as the most cited living one.Sent 10: Bandura is widely described as the greatest living psychologist, and as one of the most influential psychologists of all time.Sent 11: In 1974 Bandura was elected to be the Eighty-Second President of the American Psychological Association (APA).Sent 12: He was one of the youngest president-elects in the history of the APA at the age of 48.Sent 13: Bandura served as a member of the APA Board of Scientific Affairs from 1968 to 1970 and is well known as a member of the editorial board of nine psychology journals including the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology from 1963 to 1972.Sent 14: At the age of 82, Bandura was awarded the Grawemeyer Award for psychology.\nOptions:\n0. 2010\n1. 2007\n2. 2000\n3. 2002",

    "Conclusion": "What did the CIA rely on before 9/11 to work with US personnel?",
    "Facts": "Background: Sent 1: Before 9/11, the CIA did not invest in developing a robust capability to conduct paramilitary operations with U.S. personnel.Sent 2: It relied on proxies instead, organized by CIA operatives without the requisite military training.Sent 3: The results were unsatisfactory.Sent 4: Whether the price is measured in either money or people, the United States cannot afford to build two separate capabilities for carrying out secret military operations, secretly operating standoff missiles, and secretly training foreign military or paramilitary forces.Sent 5: The United States should concentrate responsibility and necessary legal authorities in one entity.Sent 6: The post-9/11 Afghanistan precedent of using joint CIA-military teams for covert and clandestine operations was a good one.Sent 7: We believe this proposal to be consistent with it.Sent 8: Each agency would concentrate on its comparative advantages in building capabilities for joint missions.Sent 9: The operation itself would be planned in common.Sent 10: The CIA has a reputation for agility in operations.Sent 11: The military has a reputation for being methodical and cumbersome.Sent 12: We do not know if these stereotypes match current reality; they may also be one more symptom of the civil-military misunderstandings we described in chapter 4.Sent 13: It is a problem to be resolved in policy guidance and agency management, not in the creation of redundant, overlapping capabilities and authorities in such sensitive work.Sent 14: The CIA's experts should be integrated into the military's training, exercises, and planning.Sent 15: To quote a CIA official now serving in the field:\"One fight, one team.\"Sent 16: Finally, to combat the secrecy and complexity we have described, the overall amounts of money being appropriated for national intelligence and to its component agencies should no longer be kept secret.Sent 17: Congress should pass a separate appropriations act for intelligence, defending the broad allocation of how these tens of billions of dollars have been assigned among the varieties of intelligence work.Sent 18: The specifics of the intelligence appropriation would remain classified, as they are today.\nOptions:\n0.

    "Conclusion": "What led to the Tiara army defeating the Minamoto armies?",
    "Facts": "Background: Sent 1: The Golden Heian Era: The geomancers in 794 decided that Heian-kyo (modern Kyoto) would be an auspicious site for the imperial family.Sent 2: It was indeed — until 1869.Sent 3: Grants of tax-free land over the years had been made to Buddhist temples and members of the court aristocracy.Sent 4: The most powerful families thus carved out for themselves whole regions that were to become the fiefdoms of Japanese feudalism.Sent 5: By the end of the eighth century the clans had created a hierarchy of shiki, or rights, from the highest to the lowest ranks of society.Sent 6: The aristocrat or court patron lent his prestige to a powerful provincial proprietor, who employed a competent estate-manager to oversee smallholders, who in turn worked their farms with dependent laborers.Sent 7: This elaborate structure of interdependent rights and obligations was to serve Japanese society right into the 20th century.Sent 8: Meanwhile, Heian court life blossomed in an effusion of aesthetic expression.Sent 9: Princes and princesses judged the merits of birds, insects, flowers, roots, or seashells.Sent 10: Literary party games held in ornate palace gardens required each guest to compose a small poem as his wine cup floated toward him along a miniature winding channel of water.Sent 11: Expeditions were organized to the best viewing points for the first spring cherry blossoms, and special pavilions were built to watch the rising of the full moon.Sent 12: Every gesture, from the most banal opening of an umbrella to the sublimest act of lovemaking, had its appropriate ceremonial.Sent 13: Conversation often took the form of elegant exchanges of improvised verse.Sent 14: The changing role of Chinese culture in Japanese life was epitomized in the language itself.Sent 15: In the absence of an indigenous alphabet, Japanese scholars had with the greatest difficulty tried to adapt the complex ideograms of monosyllabic Chinese to the essentially polysyllabic Japanese.Sent 16: Thus developed the katakana system used as a vehicle for writing Buddhist names and concepts.Sent 17: After rival Fujiwara factions had been struggling for years to gain control of the imperial throne, they turned to the Taira and Minamoto armies in 1156 to wage the four-year war that heralded the end of the golden age of the Heian court.Sent 18: The Taira, controlling the region along the Inland Sea, defeated the Minamoto armies based in the Kanto province east of the capital.\nOptions:\n0.

    "Facts": "Background: Sent 1: Zakariya Essabar, a Moroccan citizen, moved to Germany in February 1997 and to Hamburg in 1998, where he studied medical technology.Sent 2: Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque.Sent 3: Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam.Sent 4: Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle.Sent 5: Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership.Sent 6: Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993, moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University.Sent 7: A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it.Sent 8: One of Motassadeq's roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a \"good man\" and organizing film sessions that included speeches by Bin Laden.Sent 9: Motassadeq would help conceal the Hamburg group's trip to Afghanistan in late 1999.Sent 10: Abdelghani Mzoudi, also a Moroccan, arrived in Germany in the summer of 1993, after completing university courses in physics and chemistry.Sent 11: Mzoudi studied in Dortmund, Bochum, and Muenster before moving to Hamburg in 1995.Sent 12: Mzoudi described himself as a weak Muslim when he was home in Morocco, but much more devout when he was back in Hamburg.Sent 13: In April 1996, Mzoudi and Motassadeq witnessed the execution of Atta's will.Sent 14: During the course of 1999, Atta and his group became ever more extreme and secretive, speaking only in Arabic to conceal the content of their conversations.Sent 15: 87 When the four core members of the Hamburg cell left Germany to journey to Afghanistan late that year, it seems unlikely that they already knew about the planes operation; no evidence connects them to al Qaeda before that time.Sent 16: Witnesses have attested, however, that their pronouncements reflected ample predisposition toward taking some action against the United States.Sent 17: In short, they fit the bill for Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM.Sent 18: Going to Afghanistan The available evidence indicates that in 1999, Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah decided to fight in Chechnya against the Russians.\nOptions:\n0.

    "Facts": "Background: Sent 1: After the death of Spitamenes and his marriage to Roxana (Roshanak in Bactrian) to cement relations with his new satrapies, Alexander turned to the Indian subcontinent.Sent 2: He invited the chieftains of the former satrapy of Gandhara, in the north of what is now Pakistan, to come to him and submit to his authority.Sent 3: Omphis(Indian name Ambhi Kumar), the ruler of Taxila, whose kingdom extended from the Indus to the Hydaspes (Jhelum), complied, but the chieftains of some hill clans, including the Aspasioi and Assakenoi sections of the Kambojas (known in Indian texts also as Ashvayanas and Ashvakayanas), refused to submit.Sent 4: Ambhi hastened to relieve Alexander of his apprehension and met him with valuable presents, placing himself and all his forces at his disposal.Sent 5: Alexander not only returned Ambhi his title and the gifts but he also presented him with a wardrobe of \"Persian robes, gold and silver ornaments, 30 horses and 1000 talents in gold\".Sent 6: Alexander was emboldened to divide his forces, and Ambhi assisted Hephaestion and Perdiccas in constructing a bridge over the Indus where it bends at Hund (Fox 1973), supplied their troops with provisions, and received Alexander himself, and his whole army, in his capital city of Taxila, with every demonstration of friendship and the most liberal hospitality.Sent 7: On the subsequent advance of the Macedonian king, Taxiles accompanied him with a force of 5000 men and took part in the battle of the Hydaspes River.Sent 8: After that victory he was sent by Alexander in pursuit of Porus, to whom he was charged to offer favourable terms, but narrowly escaped losing his life at the hands of his old enemy.Sent 9: Subsequently, however, the two rivals were reconciled by the personal mediation of Alexander; and Taxiles, after having contributed zealously to the equipment of the fleet on the Hydaspes, was entrusted by the king with the government of the whole territory between that river and the Indus.Sent 10: A considerable accession of power was granted him after the death of Philip, son of Machatas; and he was allowed to retain his authority at the death of Alexander himself (323 BC), as well as in the subsequent partition of the provinces at Triparadisus, 321 BC.Sent 11: In the winter of 327/326 BC, Alexander personally led a campaign against these clans; the Aspasioi of Kunar valleys, the Guraeans of the Guraeus valley, and the Assakenoi of the Swat and Buner valleys.Sent 12: A fierce contest ensued with the Aspasioi in which Alexander was wounded in the shoulder by a dart, but eventually the Aspasioi lost.Sent 13: Alexander then faced the Assakenoi, who fought in the strongholds of Massaga, Ora and Aornos.Sent 14: The fort of Massaga was reduced only after days of bloody fighting, in which Alexander was wounded seriously in the ankle.Sent 15: According to Curtius, \"Not only did Alexander slaughter the entire population of Massaga, but also did he reduce its buildings to rubble\".Sent 16: A similar slaughter followed at Ora.Sent 17: In the aftermath of Massaga and Ora, numerous Assakenians fled to the fortress of Aornos.Sent 18: Alexander followed close behind and captured the strategic hill-fort after four bloody days.\nOptions:\n0.

    "Facts": "Background: Sent 1: Federal agents on Tuesday raided a South Florida office of Dr. Salomon Melgen, an eye doctor whose past issues with authorities had already entangled Sen. Robert Menendez.Sent 2: With yellow crime tape strung up outside, men and women lugged box after box of materials from Melgen's West Palm Beach office into awaiting minivans.Sent 3: Both members of the federal Health and Human Services department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation took part in the search, which FBI Special Agent Michael Leverock said was the second at the same Melgen clinic -- the other coming last January.Sent 4: \"As this is part of an ongoing investigation, (authorities have) no further comment/information at this time,\" said Leverock.Sent 5: That means no official details as to what authorities were looking for.Sent 6: Even if it has nothing to do with his record as a generous political donor, Tuesday's raid suggests Melgen's legal troubles and perhaps their negative impact on Menendez, the senior U.S. senator from New Jersey are far from over.Sent 7: Confessions show sex claims were 'false smears,' senator says The doctor's lawyer contended that Tuesday's search was the government's way of getting back at Melgen, after he sued over Medicare payments.Sent 8: Even so, Matthew Menchel, the attorney, said that Melgen will continue to work with authorities.Sent 9: \"While we believe that today's intrusion was in retaliation and there was no legitimate need for the search, the FBI's actions will not prevent Dr. Melgen from continuing his full cooperation with the government,\" Menchel said.Sent 10: The doctor first came to the attention of many around Washington when The Daily Caller, a conservative website, published a report shortly before the November 2012 election citing several Dominican women who claimed they'd had sex with Menendez for money.Sent 11: The New Jersey Democrat staunchly denied the accusation.Sent 12: And in March, Dominican police announced three women had been paid to claim -- falsely -- that they had sex with Menendez.Sent 13: While that part of the story died down, the episode raised questions about why and how Menendez admittedly flew to the Dominican Republic three times in 2010 on Melgen's private plane.\nOptions:\n0.

    "Facts": "Background: Sent 1: (CNN) -- Deposed Honduran President Jose Manuel Zelaya will not be reinstated as head of state, an overwhelming majority of the Honduran congress voted Wednesday.Sent 2: In an hours-long process, 111 lawmakers voted in favor of a motion not to return Zelaya to office.Sent 3: A majority of 65 votes in the 128-member body was required to reject his reinstatement.Sent 4: Zelaya was removed from office in a military-led coup on June 28 and replaced by congressional leader Roberto Micheletti.Sent 5: On Wednesday, lawmakers voted one by one and addressed the chamber as they cast their vote, making for a slow process.Sent 6: The vote was a key part of a U.S.-brokered pact that representatives for Zelaya and Micheletti signed October 29, giving Congress the power to decide Zelaya's fate.Sent 7: The United States expressed disappointment Thursday over the latest rebuff to its diplomatic efforts to end the political crisis in Honduras.Sent 8: U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Arturo Valenzuela continued to call on the Honduran government to allow Zelaya's return and to create a unity government in the interim period before the new president takes office next month.Sent 9: \"We are disappointed by this decision since the United States had hoped the [Honduran] Congress would have approved his return,\" Valenzuela said in a conference call with journalists in Washington.Sent 10: \"Our policy since June 28 has been consistently principled.Sent 11: It has condemned the coup d'etat and continued to accept President Zelaya as the democratically elected and legitimate leader of Honduras throughout this political crisis.\"Sent 12: The United States continues to call for Honduras to engage in national reconciliation and creation of a truth commission to investigate the crisis, in addition to the unity government.Sent 13: \"The absence of democratic, constitutional order is the unacceptable status quo,\" a senior U.S. administration official said on the conference call, remaining anonymous under the ground rules of the call and because of the sensitivity of the situation.Sent 14: \"The election is a step toward a day where Honduras will have an electorally legitimate government in place.\"\nOptions:\n0.

Sent 2: I never turn back, though often so inclined, and in this particular instance, amid such surroundings, everything seemed singularly unfavorable for the calm acceptance of so grim a company. Sent 3: Suppressing my fears, I soon discovered that although as hairy as bears and as crooked as summit pines, the strange creatures were sufficiently erect to belong to our own species. Sent 4: They proved to be nothing more formidable than Mono Indians dressed in the skins of sage-rabbits. Sent 5: Both the men and the women begged persistently for whisky and tobacco, and seemed so accustomed to denials that I found it impossible to convince them that I had none to give. Sent 6: Excepting the names of these two products of civilization, they seemed to understand not a word of English; but I afterward learned that they were on their way to Yosemite Valley to feast awhile on trout and procure a load of acorns to carry back through the pass to their huts on the shore of Mono Lake.\nOptions:\n0.

    "Facts": "Background: Sent 1: Bin Laden began delivering diatribes against the United States before he left Saudi Arabia.Sent 2: He continued to do so after he arrived in Sudan.Sent 3: In early 1992, the al Qaeda leadership issued a fatwa calling for jihad against the Western \"occupation\" of Islamic lands.Sent 4: Specifically singling out U.S. forces for attack, the language resembled that which would appear in Bin Laden's public fatwa in August 1996.Sent 5: In ensuing weeks, Bin Laden delivered an often-repeated lecture on the need to cut off \"the head of the snake.\"Sent 6: By this time, Bin Laden was well-known and a senior figure among Islamist extremists, especially those in Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region.Sent 7: Still, he was just one among many diverse terrorist barons.Sent 8: Some of Bin Laden's close comrades were more peers than subordinates.Sent 9: For example, Usama Asmurai, also known as Wali Khan, worked with Bin Laden in the early 1980s and helped him in the Philippines and in Tajikistan.Sent 10: The Egyptian spiritual guide based in New Jersey, the Blind Sheikh, whom Bin Laden admired, was also in the network.Sent 11: Among sympathetic peers in Afghanistan were a few of the warlords still fighting for power and Abu Zubaydah, who helped operate a popular terrorist training camp near the border with Pakistan.Sent 12: There were also rootless but experienced operatives, such as Ramzi Yousef and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who-though not necessarily formal members of someone else's organization-were traveling around the world and joining in projects that were supported by or linked to Bin Laden, the Blind Sheikh, or their associates.Sent 13: In now analyzing the terrorist programs carried out by members of this network, it would be misleading to apply the label \"al Qaeda operations\" too often in these early years.Sent 14: Yet it would also be misleading to ignore the significance of these connections.Sent 15: And in this network, Bin Laden's agenda stood out.Sent 16: While his allied Islamist groups were focused on local battles, such as those in Egypt, Algeria, Bosnia, or Chechnya, Bin Laden concentrated on attacking the \"far enemy\"-the United States.Sent 17: After U.S. troops deployed to Somalia in late 1992, al Qaeda leaders formulated a fatwa demanding their eviction.Sent 18: In December, bombs exploded at two hotels in Aden where U.S. troops routinely stopped en route to Somalia, killing two, but no Americans.\nOptions:\n0.

    "Conclusion": " Bin Laden's Fatwa was released in what year and contained wording that was originally released by what group four years earlier?",
    "Facts": "Background: Sent 1: Bin Laden began delivering diatribes against the United States before he left Saudi Arabia.Sent 2: He continued to do so after he arrived in Sudan.Sent 3: In early 1992, the al Qaeda leadership issued a fatwa calling for jihad against the Western \"occupation\" of Islamic lands.Sent 4: Specifically singling out U.S. forces for attack, the language resembled that which would appear in Bin Laden's public fatwa in August 1996.Sent 5: In ensuing weeks, Bin Laden delivered an often-repeated lecture on the need to cut off \"the head of the snake.\"Sent 6: By this time, Bin Laden was well-known and a senior figure among Islamist extremists, especially those in Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula, and the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region.Sent 7: Still, he was just one among many diverse terrorist barons.Sent 8: Some of Bin Laden's close comrades were more peers than subordinates.Sent 9: For example, Usama Asmurai, also known as Wali Khan, worked with Bin Laden in the early 1980s and helped him in the Philippines and in Tajikistan.Sent 10: The Egyptian spiritual guide based in New Jersey, the Blind Sheikh, whom Bin Laden admired, was also in the network.Sent 11: Among sympathetic peers in Afghanistan were a few of the warlords still fighting for power and Abu Zubaydah, who helped operate a popular terrorist training camp near the border with Pakistan.Sent 12: There were also rootless but experienced operatives, such as Ramzi Yousef and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who-though not necessarily formal members of someone else's organization-were traveling around the world and joining in projects that were supported by or linked to Bin Laden, the Blind Sheikh, or their associates.Sent 13: In now analyzing the terrorist programs carried out by members of this network, it would be misleading to apply the label \"al Qaeda operations\" too often in these early years.Sent 14: Yet it would also be misleading to ignore the significance of these connections.Sent 15: And in this network, Bin Laden's agenda stood out.Sent 16: While his allied Islamist groups were focused on local battles, such as those in Egypt, Algeria, Bosnia, or Chechnya, Bin Laden concentrated on attacking the \"far enemy\"-the United States.Sent 17: After U.S. troops deployed to Somalia in late 1992, al Qaeda leaders formulated a fatwa demanding their eviction.Sent 18: In December, bombs exploded at two hotels in Aden where U.S. troops routinely stopped en route to Somalia, killing two, but no Americans.\nOptions:\n0. The fatwa in 1996 and its wording was similar to that of Qaeda's a few years earlier\n1. 1996 and al Quaeda\n2. The fatwa was issued in 1995 and it was similar to that of US state department's\n3.

Marx.Sent 12: The structure was completed, had structural problems, and was eventually demolished in 1993.Sent 13: The statue was gilded, and is still on display.Sent 14: A statue, by James Earle Fraser, was dedicated on May 17, 1923, on the south terrace of the Treasury Building, in Washington.\nOptions:\n0. 85\n1. 79\n2.

Sent 2: I never turn back, though often so inclined, and in this particular instance, amid such surroundings, everything seemed singularly unfavorable for the calm acceptance of so grim a company. Sent 3: Suppressing my fears, I soon discovered that although as hairy as bears and as crooked as summit pines, the strange creatures were sufficiently erect to belong to our own species. Sent 4: They proved to be nothing more formidable than Mono Indians dressed in the skins of sage-rabbits. Sent 5: Both the men and the women begged persistently for whisky and tobacco, and seemed so accustomed to denials that I found it impossible to convince them that I had none to give. Sent 6: Excepting the names of these two products of civilization, they seemed to understand not a word of English; but I afterward learned that they were on their way to Yosemite Valley to feast awhile on trout and procure a load of acorns to carry back through the pass to their huts on the shore of Mono Lake.\nOptions:\n0.

    "Facts": "Background: Sent 1: The one person who, by his interference, could have settled all doubts was debarred by circumstances from interfering in the matter. Sent 2: Wykham Delandre had quarrelled with his sister--or perhaps it was that she had quarrelled with him--and they were on terms not merely of armed neutrality but of bitter hatred. Sent 3: The quarrel had been antecedent to Margaret going to Brent's Rock. Sent 4: She and Wykham had almost come to blows. Sent 5: There had certainly been threats on one side and on the other; and in the end Wykham, overcome with passion, had ordered his sister to leave his house. Sent 6: She had risen straightway, and, without waiting to pack up even her own personal belongings, had walked out of the house. Sent 7: On the threshold she had paused for a moment to hurl a bitter threat at Wykham that he would rue in shame and despair to the last hour of his life his act of that day. Sent 8: Some weeks had since passed; and it was understood in the neighbourhood that Margaret had gone to London, when she suddenly appeared driving out with Geoffrey Brent, and the entire neighbourhood knew before nightfall that she had taken up her abode at the Rock. Sent 9: It was no subject of surprise that Brent had come back unexpectedly, for such was his usual custom. Sent 10: Even his own servants never knew when to expect him, for there was a private door, of which he alone had the key, by which he sometimes entered without anyone in the house being aware of his coming. Sent 11: This was his usual method of appearing after a long absence.\nOptions:\n0.

Sent 2: On his last day , Ben's relationship with his co-workers is presumed to be anything but a warm one . Sent 3: None of his colleagues will join him for a drink and a cake in his honor has an iced portion of the phrase `` Good riddance , asshole '' sliced out . Sent 4: Ben's cross-country drive in a 1956 Porsche 356 Speedster is interrupted when he crashes in the rural hamlet of Grady , South Carolina .

Sent 8: Though upset , Ben quickly makes friends with Mayor Nick Nicholson , the town cafe's proprietor/head waitress , and Melvin , the local mechanic tasked with repairing Ben's car . Sent 9: Ben soon finds his clinic work to be much more laid-back than the emergency room . Sent 10: He has simple cases such as spots before the eyes , fishing hook impalings , and even reading mail for a young illiterate couple , whose baby he later delivers .

Fred Rooney of Bethlehem.Sent 13: After all, politics run in the Rooney family.Sent 14: His brother, state Rep. T.J. Rooney of Bethlehem, is a power in the state Legislature and the Democratic Party.Sent 15: But on a trip to Colombia when he was a junior at Moravian, the child of privilege saw human suffering, malnutrition and poverty the likes of which he had never imagined.Sent 16: ''I couldn't understand why we live this way and they live that way,'' Rooney recalled.Sent 17: ''It's been the guiding light of my life ever since.''Sent 18: After graduating in CUNY Law School's first class in 1986, he took a job with Lehigh Valley Legal Services.\nOptions:\n0.

    "Facts": "Background: Sent 1: Zinni feared that Bin Laden would in the future locate himself in cities, where U.S. missiles could kill thousands of Afghans.Sent 2: He worried also lest Pakistani authorities not get adequate warning, think the missiles came from India, RESPONSES TO AL QAEDA'S INITIAL ASSAULTS 135 and do something that everyone would later regret.Sent 3: Discussing potential repercussions in the region of his military responsibility, Zinni said, \"It was easy to take the shot from Washington and walk away from it.Sent 4: We had to live there.\"Sent 5: Zinni's distinct preference would have been to build up counterterrorism capabilities in neighboring countries such as Uzbekistan.Sent 6: But he told us that he could not drum up much interest in or money for such a purpose from Washington, partly, he thought, because these countries had dictatorial governments.Sent 7: After the decision-in which fear of collateral damage was an important factor- not to use cruise missiles against Kandahar in December 1998, Shelton and officers in the Pentagon developed plans for using an AC-130 gunship instead of cruise missile strikes.Sent 8: Designed specifically for the special forces, the version of the AC-130 known as \"Spooky\"can fly in fast or from high altitude, undetected by radar; guided to its zone by extraordinarily complex electronics, it is capable of rapidly firing precision-guided 25, 40, and 105 mm projectiles.Sent 9: Because this system could target more precisely than a salvo of cruise missiles, it had a much lower risk of causing collateral damage.Sent 10: After giving Clarke a briefing and being encouraged to proceed, Shelton formally directed Zinni and General Peter Schoomaker, who headed the Special Operations Command, to develop plans for an AC-130 mission against Bin Laden's headquarters and infrastructure in Afghanistan.Sent 11: The Joint Staff prepared a decision paper for deployment of the Special Operations aircraft.Sent 12: Though Berger and Clarke continued to indicate interest in this option, the AC-130s were never deployed.Sent 13: Clarke wrote at the time that Zinni opposed their use, and John Maher, the Joint Staff 's deputy director of operations, agreed that this was Zinni's position.Sent 14: Zinni himself does not recall blocking the option.Sent 15: He told us that he understood the Special Operations Command had never thought the intelligence good enough to justify actually moving AC-130s into position.Sent 16: Schoomaker says, on the contrary, that he thought the AC-130 option feasible.Sent 17: The most likely explanation for the two generals' differing recollections is that both of them thought serious preparation for any such operations would require a long-term redeployment of Special Operations forces to the Middle East or South Asia.Sent 18: The AC-130s would need bases because the aircraft's unrefueled range was only a little over 2,000 miles.\nOptions:\n0.

Sent 3: No Martialist would dream of poisoning his blood and besotting his brain with alcohol in any form.

Sent 5: But as with the luxury of intoxication in Europe, so in Mars indulgence in these drugs, freely permitted to the one sex, is strictly forbidden by opinion and domestic rule to the other.

We also can agree that older Oklahomans - like all citizens - have rights to control their health care until they become incapacitated or these rights are transferred to another by legal document or process.Sent 10: \"Old\" is not a legal classification that results in automatic loss of these rights.Sent 11: Moreover, having an old parent does not automatically confer on children the right to make the parents' health care choices.Sent 12: It follows that an important role lawyers provide for aging Oklahomans is not only to create rights - transferring documents such as durable powers of attorney and guardianship orders, but also to monitor their use.Sent 13: In family situations, for example, lawyers must ensure that powers of attorney and guardianships are used to serve only the person transferring or losing rights.Sent 14: They are not to be used to help a family \"manage\" their mother or help a doctor or nursing home get permission for a pill or procedure they feel is in the best interest of a patient.Sent 15: Good news: Oklahoma now has a Public Guardianship Program, albeit unfunded, that will supply lawyers to perform this rights-monitoring process Oklahoma grandparents should be able to enjoy their grandchildren, not raise them.Sent 16: But owing to the social problems of divorce and drug use, grandparents are increasingly being called on to raise their grandchildren because of missing parents.Sent 17: Adding to the physical, emotional and financial burden they take on, grandparents face legal problems.Sent 18: All the decisions parents made without a second thought now require evidence of legal authority when made by grandparents.\nOptions:\n0. No\n1. No lawyers cannot help in this situation\n2. Yes\n3. Yes Lawyers can Transfer Guardianship orders and monitor it's use",

Sent 7: On the threshold she had paused for a moment to hurl a bitter threat at Wykham that he would rue in shame and despair to the last hour of his life his act of that day. Sent 8: Some weeks had since passed; and it was understood in the neighbourhood that Margaret had gone to London, when she suddenly appeared driving out with Geoffrey Brent, and the entire neighbourhood knew before nightfall that she had taken up her abode at the Rock. Sent 9: It was no subject of surprise that Brent had come back unexpectedly, for such was his usual custom. Sent 10: Even his own servants never knew when to expect him, for there was a private door, of which he alone had the key, by which he sometimes entered without anyone in the house being aware of his coming.

    "Conclusion": "What field has struggled long and hard to prove that mind, mood and behavior can be studied empirically?",
    "Facts": "Background: Sent 1: Critics say that is not nearly enough compared with other prescribers, such as M.D. psychiatrists or nurse practitioners who have at least six years' medical education and clinical experience.Sent 2: Neither Davison nor most other RxP opponents doubt the efficacy of medications.Sent 3: Their greatest objection is to the notion of turning psychology into a prescribing profession.Sent 4: In a field that has struggled long and hard to prove that mind, mood and behavior can be studied empirically, the past decade, Davison says, has seen \"exciting developments\" that demonstrate the validity of various psychotherapeutic interventions and the psychosocial-behavioral models on which they are based.Sent 5: \"The timing is peculiar to abandon psychological science or to convert it to a medical science,\" explains Elaine M. Heiby of the University of Hawaii, who chairs a committee of the 1,000-member American Association of Applied and Preventive Psychology that is concerned about the medicalization of psychology.Sent 6: \"Making sure that practicing psychologists are giving patients interventions based on the best available psychological science should be the APA's priority,\" argues Emory University's Scott Lilienfeld, president of the Society for a Science of Clinical Psychology (SSCP).Sent 7: More than any philosophical betrayal of psychology, RxP opponents fear that the movement will undermine the science they love.Sent 8: They believe that if prescriptive authority becomes the norm, biomedical requirements will inevitably seep into the psychology curriculum, at the expense of traditional psychological science and methodology.Sent 9: Lilienfeld feels that many clinical psychologists already receive inadequate training in fundamentals such as research design and evaluation.Sent 10: RxP opponents charge the APA with pushing its prescription-privileges agenda without adequately assessing support for it in the field.Sent 11: The 300-member SSCP is the only group within the APA to have taken a formal stance against prescription privileges.Sent 12: The APA has scheduled 30 minutes at its meeting in August for an RxP debate, but its leadership believes it already has an accurate sense of support for its RxP policy.Sent 13: \"Except for this small vocal minority, we have just not gotten a lot of groundswell against this from members,\" says APA president Philip G. Zimbardo of Stanford University.Sent 14: With prescription privileges now a reality in one state, some RxP opponents concede that it may be too late.Sent 15: This year four states besides New Mexico -- Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois and Tennessee -- have pending legislation for psychologist prescription privileges.Sent 16: Over the past decade, 14 state legislatures have considered such laws.Sent 17: Between 1991 and 1997, a U.S. Department of Defense psychopharmacology demonstration project involving two to four years' training produced 10 military psychologists who can write prescriptions.\nOptions:\n0.

    "Facts": "Background: Sent 1: To make certain the U.S. was aware of the danger, in July 1939, a few months before the beginning of World War II in Europe, Szilard and Wigner visited Einstein to explain the possibility of atomic bombs, which Einstein, a pacifist, said he had never considered.Sent 2: He was asked to lend his support by writing a letter, with Szilard, to President Roosevelt, recommending the U.S. pay attention and engage in its own nuclear weapons research.Sent 3: A secret German facility, apparently the largest of the Third Reich, covering 75 acres in an underground complex, was being re-excavated in Austria in December 2014 and may have been planned for use in nuclear research and development.Sent 4: The letter is believed to be \"arguably the key stimulus for the U.S. adoption of serious investigations into nuclear weapons on the eve of the U.S. entry into World War II\".Sent 5: In addition to the letter, Einstein used his connections with the Belgian Royal Family and the Belgian queen mother to get access with a personal envoy to the White House's Oval Office.Sent 6: President Roosevelt could not take the risk of allowing Hitler to possess atomic bombs first.Sent 7: As a result of Einstein's letter and his meetings with Roosevelt, the U.S. entered the \"race\" to develop the bomb, drawing on its \"immense material, financial, and scientific resources\" to initiate the Manhattan Project.Sent 8: It became the only country to successfully develop an atomic bomb during World War II.Sent 9: For Einstein, \"war was a disease ... [and] he called for resistance to war.\"Sent 10: By signing the letter to Roosevelt he went against his pacifist principles.Sent 11: In 1954, a year before his death, Einstein said to his old friend, Linus Pauling, \"I made one great mistake in my life--when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some justification--the danger that the Germans would make them ...\"\nOptions:\n0.

    "Facts": "Background: Sent 1: Federal agents on Tuesday raided a South Florida office of Dr. Salomon Melgen, an eye doctor whose past issues with authorities had already entangled Sen. Robert Menendez.Sent 2: With yellow crime tape strung up outside, men and women lugged box after box of materials from Melgen's West Palm Beach office into awaiting minivans.Sent 3: Both members of the federal Health and Human Services department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation took part in the search, which FBI Special Agent Michael Leverock said was the second at the same Melgen clinic -- the other coming last January.Sent 4: \"As this is part of an ongoing investigation, (authorities have) no further comment/information at this time,\" said Leverock.Sent 5: That means no official details as to what authorities were looking for.Sent 6: Even if it has nothing to do with his record as a generous political donor, Tuesday's raid suggests Melgen's legal troubles and perhaps their negative impact on Menendez, the senior U.S. senator from New Jersey are far from over.Sent 7: Confessions show sex claims were 'false smears,' senator says The doctor's lawyer contended that Tuesday's search was the government's way of getting back at Melgen, after he sued over Medicare payments.Sent 8: Even so, Matthew Menchel, the attorney, said that Melgen will continue to work with authorities.Sent 9: \"While we believe that today's intrusion was in retaliation and there was no legitimate need for the search, the FBI's actions will not prevent Dr. Melgen from continuing his full cooperation with the government,\" Menchel said.Sent 10: The doctor first came to the attention of many around Washington when The Daily Caller, a conservative website, published a report shortly before the November 2012 election citing several Dominican women who claimed they'd had sex with Menendez for money.Sent 11: The New Jersey Democrat staunchly denied the accusation.Sent 12: And in March, Dominican police announced three women had been paid to claim -- falsely -- that they had sex with Menendez.Sent 13: While that part of the story died down, the episode raised questions about why and how Menendez admittedly flew to the Dominican Republic three times in 2010 on Melgen's private plane.\nOptions:\n0.
