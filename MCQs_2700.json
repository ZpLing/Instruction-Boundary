F. Skinner, Sigmund Freud, and Jean Piaget, and as the most cited living one.Sent 10: Bandura is widely described as the greatest living psychologist, and as one of the most influential psychologists of all time.Sent 11: In 1974 Bandura was elected to be the Eighty-Second President of the American Psychological Association (APA).Sent 12: He was one of the youngest president-elects in the history of the APA at the age of 48.Sent 13: Bandura served as a member of the APA Board of Scientific Affairs from 1968 to 1970 and is well known as a member of the editorial board of nine psychology journals including the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology from 1963 to 1972.Sent 14: At the age of 82, Bandura was awarded the Grawemeyer Award for psychology.",

    "question": "A state enacted a statute prohibiting any motor vehicle traveling within the state from having window tinting or glass coating of any kind. The bill passed the state legislature at the urging of state and local law enforcement agencies who argued that tinted windows prevented them from observing interior car activity. Most citizens also supported the bill, especially after a state trooper was killed by an occupant in a window-tinted limousine. The trooper was unable to see that his assailant was armed and dangerous when he approached the vehicle for a speeding infraction. A limousine company operates a limo service in a neighboring state and has a fleet of 68 limos, all of which have tinted windows. Each year, the company makes thousands of trips into the state to transport passengers to the international airport situated 10 miles from the border separating the two states. Since all of its limos are manufactured with tinted windows, the company will incur great expense in ordering limos without tinting. The company brings suit to challenge the constitutionality of the state statute. Assuming that the company has proper standing to assert such an action, which of the following is their strongest constitutional argument to invalidate the aforesaid statute?",

Billy Graham.Sent 8: More than 78,000 people have fled South Kordofan and Blue Nile states since August of last year after an armed rebellion took root, the United Nations reported.Sent 9: The Sudanese government is thought to have responded to the rebellion by conducting sustained air raids with the use of Russian-made Antonov bombers, which have raised concerns over civilian casualties.Sent 10: Decades of civil war between the north and south, costing as many as 2 million lives, formally ended with a U.S.-brokered peace treaty in 2005.",

Sent 5: There had certainly been threats on one side and on the other; and in the end Wykham, overcome with passion, had ordered his sister to leave his house. Sent 6: She had risen straightway, and, without waiting to pack up even her own personal belongings, had walked out of the house. Sent 7: On the threshold she had paused for a moment to hurl a bitter threat at Wykham that he would rue in shame and despair to the last hour of his life his act of that day. Sent 8: Some weeks had since passed; and it was understood in the neighbourhood that Margaret had gone to London, when she suddenly appeared driving out with Geoffrey Brent, and the entire neighbourhood knew before nightfall that she had taken up her abode at the Rock. Sent 9: It was no subject of surprise that Brent had come back unexpectedly, for such was his usual custom.

Casey, executive director of Schuylkill Women in Crisis, finds it disturbing that in most cases, the fine for violating a PFA is little more than the fine someone would get for cruelty and abuse toward an animal.Sent 9: \"In most of the counties surrounding Schuylkill County, the penalties given for indirect criminal contempt are much stiffer than those in Schuylkill County,\" Casey said.Sent 10: \"What kind of message are we sending those who repeatedly violate Protection From Abuse orders?Sent 11: That it's OK to abuse women in Schuylkill County, because you'll only get a slap on the wrist?\"Sent 12: Under state law, the minimum fine for contempt of a PFA is $100; the maximum fine is $1,000 and up to six months in jail.Sent 13: Like others who are familiar with how the county's legal system does and doesn't work for victims of domestic violence, Casey believes some changes are in order.Sent 14: Valerie West, a manager/attorney with Mid-Penn Legal Services, with offices in Pottsville and Reading, regularly handles domestic violence cases.Sent 15: She finds fault with the local requirement that a custody order must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed.Sent 16: West said she feels a custody order should be allowed to stand for the full term of the PFA - up to 18 months - as it does in many other counties in the state.Sent 17: \"It places an undue burden on the plaintiff, in terms of cost, finding legal representation and facing their abuser - not to mention a further burden on the system to provide those services,\" West said.Sent 18: \"It may be difficult for the parties to reach an agreement so soon after violence has occurred.",

    "question": "A tall building was under construction in the downtown business district of a city. A lawyer drove her car to the downtown area to go to a meeting with a client. She was running late for the meeting and could not find a legal parking spot, so she decided to park illegally in front of a fire hydrant. This was in violation of a local ordinance that prohibited parking within 50 feet of a fire hydrant. The lawyer figured that it was better to get a ticket than to miss her meeting with an important client. The spot where she parked was next to the site of the construction of the new building. While the lawyer was at her meeting, an accident occurred at the construction site. A large crane was being used to lift a load of bricks. A cable on the crane broke, and the bricks fell. Most of them landed on top of the lawyer's car. The load of bricks that fell on the lawyer's car caused the gas tank of the car to rupture and explode. Shrapnel from the explosion flew in all directions and injured a pedestrian who was talking on the sidewalk near the lawyer's car. If the pedestrian sues the lawyer and relies on the doctrine of negligence per Se, which of the following, if true, is the lawyer's best defense?",

He knew that the Russian troops could reach the southern tip of Korea before American troops could arrive. He also knew that the Russians were on the verge of moving into Korea, or were already there. The nearest American troops to Korea were on Okinawa, 600 miles away. His problem, therefore, was to compose a surrender arrangement which, while acceptable to the Russians, would at the same time prevent them from seizing all of Korea. If they refused to confine their advance to north Korea, the United States would be unable to stop them. . . . He decided to use the 38th parallel as a hypothetical line dividing the zones within which Japanese forces in Korea would surrender to appointed American and Russian authorities.\n—Adapted from U.S. Army Lt. Paul C.

    "passage_text": "Sent 1: Albert Bandura OC (/baen'dU@r@/; born December 4, 1925) is a psychologist who is the David Starr Jordan Professor Emeritus of Social Science in Psychology at Stanford University.Sent 2: For almost six decades, he has been responsible for contributions to the field of education and to many fields of psychology, including social cognitive theory, therapy and personality psychology, and was also influential in the transition between behaviorism and cognitive psychology.Sent 3: He is known as the originator of social learning theory and the theoretical construct of self-efficacy, and is also responsible for the influential 1961 Bobo doll experiment.Sent 4: Social learning theory is how people learn through observing others.Sent 5: An example of social learning theory would be the students imitating the teacher.Sent 6: Self-efficacy is \"The belief in one's capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to manage prospective situations.\"Sent 7: To paraphrase, self-efficiacy is believing in yourself to take action.Sent 8: The Bobo Doll Experiment was how Albert Bandura studied aggression and non-aggression in children.Sent 9: A 2002 survey ranked Bandura as the fourth most-frequently cited psychologist of all time, behind B. F. Skinner, Sigmund Freud, and Jean Piaget, and as the most cited living one.Sent 10: Bandura is widely described as the greatest living psychologist, and as one of the most influential psychologists of all time.Sent 11: In 1974 Bandura was elected to be the Eighty-Second President of the American Psychological Association (APA).Sent 12: He was one of the youngest president-elects in the history of the APA at the age of 48.Sent 13: Bandura served as a member of the APA Board of Scientific Affairs from 1968 to 1970 and is well known as a member of the editorial board of nine psychology journals including the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology from 1963 to 1972.Sent 14: At the age of 82, Bandura was awarded the Grawemeyer Award for psychology.",

Davis, a British born real estate developer, for $25,000.Sent 4: Part of the proceeds were used by Eliza to purchase a new townhouse from Davis (Hamilton-Holly House) in Greenwich Village with her son Alexander.Sent 5: The Grange, first moved from its original location in 1889, was moved again in 2008 to a spot in St. Nicholas Park on land that was once part of the Hamilton estate, in Hamilton Heights, a neighborhood in upper Manhattan.Sent 6: The historic structure was restored to its original 1802 appearance in 2011, and is maintained by the National Park service as Hamilton Grange National Memorial.Sent 7: Alexander Hamilton served as one of the first trustees of the Hamilton-Oneida Academy in New York state.Sent 8: Later the Academy received a college charter in 1812, and the school was formally renamed Hamilton College.Columbia University, Hamilton's alma mater, has official memorials to Hamilton on its campus in New York City.Sent 9: The college's main classroom building for the humanities is Hamilton Hall, and a large statue of Hamilton stands in front of it.Sent 10: The university press has published his complete works in a multivolume letterpress edition.Sent 11: Columbia University's student group for ROTC cadets and Marine officer candidates is named the Alexander Hamilton Society.",

Casey, executive director of Schuylkill Women in Crisis, finds it disturbing that in most cases, the fine for violating a PFA is little more than the fine someone would get for cruelty and abuse toward an animal.Sent 9: \"In most of the counties surrounding Schuylkill County, the penalties given for indirect criminal contempt are much stiffer than those in Schuylkill County,\" Casey said.Sent 10: \"What kind of message are we sending those who repeatedly violate Protection From Abuse orders?Sent 11: That it's OK to abuse women in Schuylkill County, because you'll only get a slap on the wrist?\"Sent 12: Under state law, the minimum fine for contempt of a PFA is $100; the maximum fine is $1,000 and up to six months in jail.Sent 13: Like others who are familiar with how the county's legal system does and doesn't work for victims of domestic violence, Casey believes some changes are in order.Sent 14: Valerie West, a manager/attorney with Mid-Penn Legal Services, with offices in Pottsville and Reading, regularly handles domestic violence cases.Sent 15: She finds fault with the local requirement that a custody order must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed.Sent 16: West said she feels a custody order should be allowed to stand for the full term of the PFA - up to 18 months - as it does in many other counties in the state.Sent 17: \"It places an undue burden on the plaintiff, in terms of cost, finding legal representation and facing their abuser - not to mention a further burden on the system to provide those services,\" West said.Sent 18: \"It may be difficult for the parties to reach an agreement so soon after violence has occurred.",

    "passage_text": "Sent 1: U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell arrived here on Tuesday night for meetings with fellow foreign ministers aimed at solidifying a second front, in Southeast Asia, in the campaign against global terrorism.Sent 2: But he has had to balance that goal with longstanding concerns about human rights abuses in the region.Sent 3: In meetings on Tuesday in Malaysia and Singapore before touching down in this oil-producing sultanate for two days of talks with members of the Association of South East Asian Nations, Powell said he repeatedly raised the issue.Sent 4: \"We still believe strongly in human rights, and that everything we do has to be consistent with universal standards of human rights,\" he said.Sent 5: But at a news conference in Singapore, Powell hinted that the Bush administration was ready to discuss resuming military cooperation with Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation and a sometimes reluctant partner in the efforts to crack down on militant Islamic groups.Sent 6: The United States cut virtually all military links with Indonesia in 1999 after its forces were implicated in the violence that swept East Timor after that territory voted for independence.Sent 7: On Thursday, Powell and representatives of the nations of the Asian group, including Indonesia, are expected to sign a declaration promising cooperation to prevent terrorism by sharing information, blocking funds, tightening borders and making it hard to use forged travel papers.Sent 8: \"We recognized that terrorism is a global threat and that the disturbing acts of terrorism and transnational crimes, which continue to threaten world peace and stability, must be tackled by the international community,\" the ministers said in a communique on Tuesday.Sent 9: Powell is among the representatives from 13 nations outside Southeast Asia, including China, Japan and Russia, that are taking part in the annual meeting of the group's regional forum.Sent 10: Terrorism dominates the agenda, though the possibility of a meeting here between Powell and his North Korean counterpart, Paek Nam Sun, has generated the most news.Sent 11: It would be the highest-level contact between the United States and North Korea since President Bush took office.Sent 12: Powell heads to Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, late on Thursday before finishing a weeklong trip through the region in the Philippines on Saturday.Sent 13: He said that when he arrives in Jakarta, he will have \"some ideas and some initiatives\" to present to President Megawati Sukarnoputri.Sent 14: Indonesia is already receiving $400,000 in the current fiscal year for civilian training programs and is to receive a like amount next year; and the United States expects to provide an additional $16 million this year to train police officers in counterterrorism.Sent 15: At the same time, the Pentagon is reviewing how to allocate another $17 million in \"counterterrorism fellowships,\" some of which could go to Indonesia.Sent 16: But a senior State Department official also acknowledged that some in the administration and Congress are pushing for more direct military cooperation, which would require congressional approval.Sent 17: \"I think they recognize the danger that we all face and I think they have been cooperating more fully with us as time goes by, and I'm quite sure that Mrs. Megawati is committed to this cause,\" Powell said in Singapore.Sent 18: He met there with Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, who endorsed the idea of renewed military ties between the United States and Indonesia as an important step in stabilizing that country.",

Sent 3: The quarrel had been antecedent to Margaret going to Brent's Rock. Sent 4: She and Wykham had almost come to blows. Sent 5: There had certainly been threats on one side and on the other; and in the end Wykham, overcome with passion, had ordered his sister to leave his house. Sent 6: She had risen straightway, and, without waiting to pack up even her own personal belongings, had walked out of the house. Sent 7: On the threshold she had paused for a moment to hurl a bitter threat at Wykham that he would rue in shame and despair to the last hour of his life his act of that day. Sent 8: Some weeks had since passed; and it was understood in the neighbourhood that Margaret had gone to London, when she suddenly appeared driving out with Geoffrey Brent, and the entire neighbourhood knew before nightfall that she had taken up her abode at the Rock. Sent 9: It was no subject of surprise that Brent had come back unexpectedly, for such was his usual custom. Sent 10: Even his own servants never knew when to expect him, for there was a private door, of which he alone had the key, by which he sometimes entered without anyone in the house being aware of his coming.

Rick Perry.Sent 4: The law says that at least 24 hours before an abortion is performed, women must undergo a sonogram, a procedure that uses ultrasound to create an image.Sent 5: The doctor, then, is required to give, \"in a manner understandable to a layperson, a verbal explanation of the results of the sonogram images, including a medical description of the dimensions of the embryo or fetus, the presence of cardiac activity, and the presence of external members and internal organs,\" the law states.Sent 6: There are some exceptions, including pregnancies that resulted from sexual assault, incest or other violations of law.Sent 7: Women seeking abortions also are exempt if the fetus has been found to have an irreversible medical condition that will cause a disability.Sent 8: \"Governor Perry was pleased to sign this important legislation, which bolsters our efforts to protect life by ensuring Texans are fully informed when considering such an important decision,\" said his deputy press secretary, Lucy Nashed.Sent 9: Critics say the new law is unnecessary.Sent 10: \"What no one is focusing on is that this is a mandate to humiliate women who want an abortion,\" said Yvonne Gutierrez, vice president for public affairs at the Planned Parenthood Trust of South Texas.Sent 11: Texas already requires a 24-hour consent period, and the new law will simply add emotional and financial costs to those seeking abortions, she said.",

Frank O'Bannon to sit on the Indiana Court of Appeals First District, where he works today.Sent 8: Despite his quick climb up the legal ladder, Bailey has always found time to help out in causes he feels strongly about.Sent 9: It was for his dedication to the law and the people that are affected by it that he was recently recognized.Sent 10: The Indiana Pro Bono Commission hosted its annual celebration event, the Randall T.

The three sailors had gone without food for two weeks and were on the verge of dying of starvation. Each of the sailors, however, still had a small amount of water left in their canteens with which to subsist. One night, the defendant took the water from the victim's canteen and poured it into his own canteen while the victim slept. The defendant did this in the hope that the extra water would make it possible for him to live a couple of more days so that he would be able to walk across the island to look for help. The next day, the victim died from starvation and dehydration. Two days later, the defendant and the other sailor were rescued. The defendant never walked across the island because he was too weak from body weight loss.",

As the defendant and the victim were climbing a dangerously steep incline, their ropes suddenly became entangled. As a result of the entanglement, the victim fell 50 feet before he was able to regain his balance and footing. However, the victim's fall caused the defendant to lose his balance, and he was in jeopardy of falling off the mountain. In order to avoid falling, the defendant cut the safety rope that held the victim. This caused the victim to fall 400 feet to his death.",

In order to avoid crashing head-on with the school bus, the defendant turned his vehicle onto the sidewalk and struck a victim, a paraplegic, who was confined to a wheelchair. The defendant's auto crushed the victim to death.",

As they were being pursued by the police, the defendant was commanded to drive excessively fast to avoid being captured. While driving at a speed of nearly 100 M. P. H. , the defendant approached a busy intersection and saw the victim, a blind person, with a guide dog walking across the street. She slowed down to avoid hitting the pedestrian with the dog. As she did so, one of the robbers stuck a gun against her head and threatened to kill her if she didn't speed through the intersection. Afraid she would be murdered, the defendant accelerated into the path of the victim, killing him and his guide dog."

Sent 5: It was prettily furnished in white, with white curtains, and toilet-table articles in ivory to match. Sent 6: A glance round the room convinced Rolfe that it was impossible for a man to secrete himself in it. Sent 7: The door of the wardrobe had been flung open by the inspector, and the dresses and other articles of feminine apparel it contained flung out on the floor. Sent 8: There was no other hiding-place possible, except beneath the bed, and the ruthless hand of the inspector had torn off the white muslin bed hangings, revealing emptiness underneath. Sent 9: Rolfe went out into the hall again, and entered the room next the bedroom. Sent 10: This apartment was apparently used as a dining-room, for it contained a large table, a few chairs, a small sideboard, a spirit-stand, a case of books and ornaments, and two small oak presses. Sent 11: Plainly, there was no place in it where a man could hide himself. Sent 12: The next room was the bathroom, which was also empty.

Sent 2: It is a great grazing and breeding country. Sent 3: There are many haras (breeding stables) in the neighbourhood, and the big Norman posters are much in demand. Sent 4: I have friends who never take their horses to the country. Sent 5: They hire for the season a pair of strong Norman horses that go all day up and down hill at the same regular pace and who get over a vast amount of country. Sent 6: We stopped once or twice when we were a large party, two or three carriages, and had tea at one of the numerous farmhouses that were scattered about. Sent 7: Boiling water was a difficulty--milk, cider, good bread and butter, cheese we could always find--sometimes a galette, but a kettle and boiling water were entirely out of their habits.

(LSC), a quasi-governmental agency that provides legal aid for the poor, would receive $329 million in fiscal 2004 under President Bush's proposal - the same amount requested in 2003 and approved for 2002 and 2001.Sent 2: If approved, the hold-the-line request for LSC means its budget would erode with inflation for another year, but it could be worse for the organization: Many conservatives fought for years to do away with the LSC altogether, saying legal services attorneys were spending too much time fighting for liberal causes or pursuing politically charged cases against the government instead of representing the needy.Sent 3: Opposition to the organization has cooled since 1996, when Congress approved restrictions (PL 104-134) on the sorts of cases federally funded legal aid attorneys can take.Sent 4: (1996 Almanac, p.Sent 5: 5-36) Republicans cut the organization's budget deeply in 1996, but its funding has recovered slowly.Sent 6: Last month, in the omnibus spending bill for fiscal 2003, the Senate added a onetime increase of $19 million, which, if approved in the final version, would bring the LSC budget to $348 million.Sent 7: The money would go to help states, such as Michigan and Ohio, that lost money when the organization redistributed its funding based on census counts made in 2000 of poor households.Sent 8: If the extra money survives a conference with the House and makes it to the president's desk, LSC supporters may try to include it in the organization's fiscal 2004 funding.Sent 9: The federal government began funding some programs to provide legal assistance to the poor in the late 1960s; the Legal Services Corporation was created in 1974 (PL 93-355).Sent 10: LSC gives nearly all its money to state and local agencies, which provide civil legal assistance to those whose income is less than 125 percent of the federal poverty level - $11,075 a year for an individual and $22,625 for a family of four.Sent 11: Funding for legal services goes to defend needy clients in domestic violence cases, custody cases and other such matters, according to LSC.Sent 12: Since 1996, lawyers who receive money from Legal Services have been prohibited from such activities as lobbying legislatures, filing class-action suits, participating in political demonstrations or strikes, pursuing abortion-related litigation, representing illegal aliens or prisoners, or defending public housing tenants evicted because they were charged with selling drugs",

Don't you think she's entitled to have a lawyer to get a temporary restraining order from this guy?\"Sent 13: LSSM operates like a law firm, but does not charge fees to their clients.Sent 14: Due to federal guidelines, LSSM does not accept cases concerning criminal, post-criminal, or municipal court matters.Sent 15: Rather, the attorneys provide pro bono counsel in matters such as protecting victims of spouse or child abuse, protecting individuals and families from loss of housing through illegal eviction or assisting the elderly in disputing Medicaid claim denials.Sent 16: \"One example of a case we recently handled was over in Springfield,\" Alexander said.Sent 17: \"There was an elderly woman who had some plumbing work done to her home and the work was not up to standards and the cost was above what it should have been ... we were able to help her through our pro bono program.Sent 18: One local Springfield attorney volunteered to handle the case.\"",

    "passage_text": "Sent 1: Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that laboratory tests on popular smoking devices known as electronic cigarettes have found they contain carcinogens and other toxic chemicals dangerous to humans.Sent 2: E-cigarettes are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals.Sent 3: Known as \"e-cigarettes,\" the devices are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals, spiced with flavors such as chocolate, cola or bubble gum.Sent 4: While manufacturers tout e-cigarettes as a \"healthy way\" to smoke, federal health officials say the devices turn nicotine, which is highly addictive, and other chemicals into a vapor that is inhaled by the user.Sent 5: \"The FDA is concerned about the safety of these products and how they are marketed to the public,\" said Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg, commissioner of the FDA.Sent 6: CNN contacted Florida-based Smoking Everywhere, one of the largest manufacturers of e-cigarettes, after the FDA announcement, and a spokeswoman said the company had no comment.Sent 7: Because e-cigarettes have not been submitted to the FDA for evaluation or approval, the agency had no way of knowing the levels of nicotine or the amounts or kinds of other chemicals that the various brands of these products deliver to the user.Sent 8: That is why the FDA began to test them.Sent 9: The FDA's Division of Pharmaceutical Analysis analyzed the ingredients in a small sample of cartridges from two leading brands of e-cigarettes.Sent 10: In releasing its information, the FDA did not identify the two companies, but said in one sample, diethylene glycol -- a chemical used in antifreeze that is toxic to humans -- was detected.Sent 11: Other samples detected carcinogens that are dangerous to those who smoke them, the FDA said.Sent 12: The FDA has been examining and seizing shipments of non-U.S.-made e-cigarettes at the U.S. border since summer 2008.Sent 13: To date, 50 shipments have been stopped.Sent 14: The products examined thus far meet the definition of a combination drug-device product under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.Sent 15: \"We know very little about these devices, said Dr. Jonathan Samet, director of the Institute for Global Health at the University of Southern California, \"but to say they are healthy -- that's highly doubtful.\"",

    "passage_text": "Sent 1: Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Wednesday that laboratory tests on popular smoking devices known as electronic cigarettes have found they contain carcinogens and other toxic chemicals dangerous to humans.Sent 2: E-cigarettes are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals.Sent 3: Known as \"e-cigarettes,\" the devices are battery-operated and contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals, spiced with flavors such as chocolate, cola or bubble gum.Sent 4: While manufacturers tout e-cigarettes as a \"healthy way\" to smoke, federal health officials say the devices turn nicotine, which is highly addictive, and other chemicals into a vapor that is inhaled by the user.Sent 5: \"The FDA is concerned about the safety of these products and how they are marketed to the public,\" said Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg, commissioner of the FDA.Sent 6: CNN contacted Florida-based Smoking Everywhere, one of the largest manufacturers of e-cigarettes, after the FDA announcement, and a spokeswoman said the company had no comment.Sent 7: Because e-cigarettes have not been submitted to the FDA for evaluation or approval, the agency had no way of knowing the levels of nicotine or the amounts or kinds of other chemicals that the various brands of these products deliver to the user.Sent 8: That is why the FDA began to test them.Sent 9: The FDA's Division of Pharmaceutical Analysis analyzed the ingredients in a small sample of cartridges from two leading brands of e-cigarettes.Sent 10: In releasing its information, the FDA did not identify the two companies, but said in one sample, diethylene glycol -- a chemical used in antifreeze that is toxic to humans -- was detected.Sent 11: Other samples detected carcinogens that are dangerous to those who smoke them, the FDA said.Sent 12: The FDA has been examining and seizing shipments of non-U.S.-made e-cigarettes at the U.S. border since summer 2008.Sent 13: To date, 50 shipments have been stopped.Sent 14: The products examined thus far meet the definition of a combination drug-device product under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.Sent 15: \"We know very little about these devices, said Dr. Jonathan Samet, director of the Institute for Global Health at the University of Southern California, \"but to say they are healthy -- that's highly doubtful.\"",

Charles Geveden, D-Wickliffe, would double the portion of the fee that goes to Legal Aid -- in district court to $10 from $5 and in circuit court to $20 from $10.Sent 3: Kentucky's current fee for filing a case in district court is $50.50, and in circuit court $108.Sent 4: The increase still would leave Kentucky's filing fee costs below those of surrounding states and would raise about $1.3 million a year -- almost enough to replace what Legal Aid is losing from federal and other sources, said Jamie Hamon, executive director of the Access to Justice Foundation, a state poverty law resource center in Lexington.Sent 5: Geveden said his measure appears to be the only potential source of money for the program, which is being forced to lay off workers and close offices around the state.Sent 6: Geveden said he's concerned because federal funding hasn't increased in recent years, and states with increased poverty are taking a greater share of the money.Sent 7: ''If you don't come up with the money somewhere, legal services to people in need will diminish or go away,'' he said.Sent 8: Hamon said the proposed bill has attracted a number of co-sponsors, and Legal Aid backers are hoping to get it passed in the upcoming legislative session.Sent 9: Hamon said she knows fee increases aren't popular with lawmakers but hopes they realize the crisis Legal Aid is facing.Sent 10: ''A lot of poor people are not going to get served,'' she said.Sent 11: The measure has the endorsement of the Kentucky Bar Association.Sent 12: The association's board of governors voted unanimously last month to back the bill, said KBA President Stephen Catron, a Bowling Green lawyer.Sent 13: Legal Aid ''has been a godsend to a great number of people in this state,'' Catron said.Sent 14: ''We simply must find a way to provide those services to the public.''Sent 15: Larry York, executive director of Appalachian Regional Defense Fund, which provides Legal Aid services in 37 Eastern Kentucky counties and is a KBA board member, said he hopes the measure is approved.Sent 16: ''It would really offset the current cuts,'' he said.",

Robert Menendez.Sent 2: With yellow crime tape strung up outside, men and women lugged box after box of materials from Melgen's West Palm Beach office into awaiting minivans.Sent 3: Both members of the federal Health and Human Services department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation took part in the search, which FBI Special Agent Michael Leverock said was the second at the same Melgen clinic -- the other coming last January.Sent 4: \"As this is part of an ongoing investigation, (authorities have) no further comment/information at this time,\" said Leverock.Sent 5: That means no official details as to what authorities were looking for.Sent 6: Even if it has nothing to do with his record as a generous political donor, Tuesday's raid suggests Melgen's legal troubles and perhaps their negative impact on Menendez, the senior U.S. senator from New Jersey are far from over.Sent 7: Confessions show sex claims were 'false smears,' senator says The doctor's lawyer contended that Tuesday's search was the government's way of getting back at Melgen, after he sued over Medicare payments.Sent 8: Even so, Matthew Menchel, the attorney, said that Melgen will continue to work with authorities.Sent 9: \"While we believe that today's intrusion was in retaliation and there was no legitimate need for the search, the FBI's actions will not prevent Dr. Melgen from continuing his full cooperation with the government,\" Menchel said.Sent 10: The doctor first came to the attention of many around Washington when The Daily Caller, a conservative website, published a report shortly before the November 2012 election citing several Dominican women who claimed they'd had sex with Menendez for money.Sent 11: The New Jersey Democrat staunchly denied the accusation.Sent 12: And in March, Dominican police announced three women had been paid to claim -- falsely -- that they had sex with Menendez.Sent 13: While that part of the story died down, the episode raised questions about why and how Menendez admittedly flew to the Dominican Republic three times in 2010 on Melgen's private plane.",

Sent 5: Both the men and the women begged persistently for whisky and tobacco, and seemed so accustomed to denials that I found it impossible to convince them that I had none to give.

    "passage_text": "Sent 1: Maximilian's death came at a time when Durer was concerned he was losing \"my sight and freedom of hand\" (perhaps caused by arthritis) and increasingly affected by the writings of Martin Luther.Sent 2: In July 1520 Durer made his fourth and last major journey, to renew the Imperial pension Maximilian had given him and to secure the patronage of the new emperor, Charles V, who was to be crowned at Aachen.Sent 3: Durer journeyed with his wife and her maid via the Rhine to Cologne and then to Antwerp, where he was well received and produced numerous drawings in silverpoint, chalk and charcoal.Sent 4: In addition to going to the coronation, he made excursions to Cologne (where he admired the painting of Stefan Lochner), Nijmegen, 's-Hertogenbosch, Bruges (where he saw Michelangelo's Madonna of Bruges), Ghent (where he admired van Eyck's altarpiece), and Zeeland.Sent 5: Durer took a large stock of prints with him and wrote in his diary to whom he gave, exchanged or sold them, and for how much.Sent 6: This provides rare information of the monetary value placed on prints at this time.Sent 7: Unlike paintings, their sale was very rarely documented.Sent 8: While providing valuable documentary evidence, Durer's Netherlandish diary also reveals that the trip was not a profitable one.Sent 9: For example, Durer offered his last portrait of Maximilian to his daughter, Margaret of Austria, but eventually traded the picture for some white cloth after Margaret disliked the portrait and declined to accept it.Sent 10: During this trip he also met Bernard van Orley, Jan Provoost, Gerard Horenbout, Jean Mone, Joachim Patinir and Tommaso Vincidor, though he did not, it seems, meet Quentin Matsys.Sent 11: At the request of Christian II of Denmark, Durer went to Brussels to paint the King's portrait.Sent 12: There he saw \"The things which have been sent to the king from the golden land\"--the Aztec treasure that Hernan Cortes had sent home to Holy Roman Emperor Charles V following the fall of Mexico.Sent 13: Durer wrote that this treasure \"was much more beautiful to me than miracles.Sent 14: These things are so precious that they have been valued at 100,000 florins\".Sent 15: Durer also appears to have been collecting for his own cabinet of curiosities, and he sent back to Nuremberg various animal horns, a piece of coral, some large fish fins, and a wooden weapon from the East Indies.Sent 16: Having secured his pension, Durer finally returned home in July 1521, having caught an undetermined illness--perhaps malaria --which afflicted him for the rest of his life, and greatly reduced his rate of work.",

Don't you think she's entitled to have a lawyer to get a temporary restraining order from this guy?\"Sent 13: LSSM operates like a law firm, but does not charge fees to their clients.Sent 14: Due to federal guidelines, LSSM does not accept cases concerning criminal, post-criminal, or municipal court matters.Sent 15: Rather, the attorneys provide pro bono counsel in matters such as protecting victims of spouse or child abuse, protecting individuals and families from loss of housing through illegal eviction or assisting the elderly in disputing Medicaid claim denials.Sent 16: \"One example of a case we recently handled was over in Springfield,\" Alexander said.Sent 17: \"There was an elderly woman who had some plumbing work done to her home and the work was not up to standards and the cost was above what it should have been ... we were able to help her through our pro bono program.Sent 18: One local Springfield attorney volunteered to handle the case.\"",

    "passage_text": "Sent 1: Critics say that is not nearly enough compared with other prescribers, such as M.D. psychiatrists or nurse practitioners who have at least six years' medical education and clinical experience.Sent 2: Neither Davison nor most other RxP opponents doubt the efficacy of medications.Sent 3: Their greatest objection is to the notion of turning psychology into a prescribing profession.Sent 4: In a field that has struggled long and hard to prove that mind, mood and behavior can be studied empirically, the past decade, Davison says, has seen \"exciting developments\" that demonstrate the validity of various psychotherapeutic interventions and the psychosocial-behavioral models on which they are based.Sent 5: \"The timing is peculiar to abandon psychological science or to convert it to a medical science,\" explains Elaine M. Heiby of the University of Hawaii, who chairs a committee of the 1,000-member American Association of Applied and Preventive Psychology that is concerned about the medicalization of psychology.Sent 6: \"Making sure that practicing psychologists are giving patients interventions based on the best available psychological science should be the APA's priority,\" argues Emory University's Scott Lilienfeld, president of the Society for a Science of Clinical Psychology (SSCP).Sent 7: More than any philosophical betrayal of psychology, RxP opponents fear that the movement will undermine the science they love.Sent 8: They believe that if prescriptive authority becomes the norm, biomedical requirements will inevitably seep into the psychology curriculum, at the expense of traditional psychological science and methodology.Sent 9: Lilienfeld feels that many clinical psychologists already receive inadequate training in fundamentals such as research design and evaluation.Sent 10: RxP opponents charge the APA with pushing its prescription-privileges agenda without adequately assessing support for it in the field.Sent 11: The 300-member SSCP is the only group within the APA to have taken a formal stance against prescription privileges.Sent 12: The APA has scheduled 30 minutes at its meeting in August for an RxP debate, but its leadership believes it already has an accurate sense of support for its RxP policy.Sent 13: \"Except for this small vocal minority, we have just not gotten a lot of groundswell against this from members,\" says APA president Philip G. Zimbardo of Stanford University.Sent 14: With prescription privileges now a reality in one state, some RxP opponents concede that it may be too late.Sent 15: This year four states besides New Mexico -- Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois and Tennessee -- have pending legislation for psychologist prescription privileges.Sent 16: Over the past decade, 14 state legislatures have considered such laws.Sent 17: Between 1991 and 1997, a U.S. Department of Defense psychopharmacology demonstration project involving two to four years' training produced 10 military psychologists who can write prescriptions.",

Frontier Province), Kashmir, and Sind (at the same time producing the word pak, meaning \"pure\"), and adding \"stan,\" the Persian suffix for the word \"country.Sent 9: \" The Muslim campaign for Partition was led by London-trained Bombay lawyer, Muhammad Ali Jinnah.Sent 10: Meanwhile, Gandhi vehemently opposed any dismemberment of the country, and tried to keep people united by fasting to uphold the spirit of love, and by focussing on the common adversary: the British.Sent 11: Advocating civil disobedience, he led his famous Salt March to the sea, to scoop up salt and circumvent the hated British salt tax.Sent 12: This put more than 60,000 in jail.Sent 13: Against this militancy, World War II did not elicit the solidarity of the first.Sent 14: Indians courageously fought alongside the British troops, in Burma, the Middle East, and Europe, but Gandhi saw the British as a provocation for Japanese invasion and was jailed yet again, for launching a \"Quit India\" campaign in the year 1942.Sent 15: Some anti-British extremists saw the Japanese as an Asian liberator.Sent 16: Winston Churchill didn't want any Indian independence and so it was probably as well for India that he was defeated by Attlee's Labor Party in 1945.Sent 17: With riots growing ever more bloody in Bengal, Bihar, and the Punjab, India's last viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, kept a mandate to make the British departure as quick and as smooth as possible.Sent 18: Quick it was — six months after his arrival — but not smooth.",

    "passage_text": "Sent 1: In the rest of the world, China's supreme sage, Kongfuzi (K'ung Fu-tzu), is better known by the romanized name \"Confucius.\" He was born in 551 b.c.Sent 2: in what is now Shandong Province in eastern China.Sent 3: So profound was his influence that eleven Chinese emperors made pilgrimages to the birthplace of the Great Teacher.Sent 4: You, too, can pay your respects at the vast temple raised on the site of his home in the small town of Qufu (Chufu), and at his tomb in the woods just to the north.Sent 5: The classics of Confucius, while seldom addressing spiritual and metaphysical matters, set standards for social and political conduct that still underlie many of the Chinese ways of doing and perceiving.Sent 6: Confucius laid great stress on the proper and harmonious relationships between ruler and subject, parent and child, teacher and student, the individual and the state.Sent 7: These relationships were deemed to be hierarchical and dictatorial.Sent 8: If the order was disturbed, dire consequences inevitably resulted.Sent 9: The son who disobeyed the father would bring disaster upon himself and his family, just as the emperor who defied the \"mandate of heaven\" or ignored the good of the empire brought ruin upon the nation.Sent 10: Over the centuries Confucius has suffered more changes of fortune than probably any other philosopher.Sent 11: Honored soon after his death as the greatest of scholars, he was later revered as semi-divine; you can still visit temples to Confucius in many Chinese cities.Sent 12: During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), however, he was denounced as a counter-revolutionary force.Sent 13: It was only after the death of Chairman Mao (1976) and the opening of China to the outside world under more progressive reformers that Confucius, too, was \"rehabilitated.\" Unlike Confucius, about whose life many specific and even colorful details are known, the philosopher Laozi (Lao Tse or Lao-Tzu) is an enigma.Sent 14: Estimates of his date of birth vary by well over a century.Sent 15: One legend even says he taught the young Confucius.Sent 16: Laozi is immortalized by his book of thoughts on man, nature, and the universe, Daodejing (\"The Way and Its Power\"), which became the major text of China's greatest indigenous religion, Daoism (Taoism).Sent 17: With its emphasis on nature, intuition, the individual, paradox (\"The knowledge which is not knowledge\"), and the cosmic flow known as \"The Way,\" Daoism became the religion of artists and philosophers.Sent 18: After the death of Confucius, the Zhou Dynasty entered a period of strife known as the \"Warring States\" period (475–221 b.c.).",

    "passage_text": "Sent 1: Backers of Legal Aid services for the poor are pushing a measure that would increase court filing fees in Kentucky to raise money for the program, which faces steep funding cuts.Sent 2: The proposed bill, sponsored by Rep. Charles Geveden, D-Wickliffe, would double the portion of the fee that goes to Legal Aid -- in district court to $10 from $5 and in circuit court to $20 from $10.Sent 3: Kentucky's current fee for filing a case in district court is $50.50, and in circuit court $108.Sent 4: The increase still would leave Kentucky's filing fee costs below those of surrounding states and would raise about $1.3 million a year -- almost enough to replace what Legal Aid is losing from federal and other sources, said Jamie Hamon, executive director of the Access to Justice Foundation, a state poverty law resource center in Lexington.Sent 5: Geveden said his measure appears to be the only potential source of money for the program, which is being forced to lay off workers and close offices around the state.Sent 6: Geveden said he's concerned because federal funding hasn't increased in recent years, and states with increased poverty are taking a greater share of the money.Sent 7: ''If you don't come up with the money somewhere, legal services to people in need will diminish or go away,'' he said.Sent 8: Hamon said the proposed bill has attracted a number of co-sponsors, and Legal Aid backers are hoping to get it passed in the upcoming legislative session.Sent 9: Hamon said she knows fee increases aren't popular with lawmakers but hopes they realize the crisis Legal Aid is facing.Sent 10: ''A lot of poor people are not going to get served,'' she said.Sent 11: The measure has the endorsement of the Kentucky Bar Association.Sent 12: The association's board of governors voted unanimously last month to back the bill, said KBA President Stephen Catron, a Bowling Green lawyer.Sent 13: Legal Aid ''has been a godsend to a great number of people in this state,'' Catron said.Sent 14: ''We simply must find a way to provide those services to the public.''Sent 15: Larry York, executive director of Appalachian Regional Defense Fund, which provides Legal Aid services in 37 Eastern Kentucky counties and is a KBA board member, said he hopes the measure is approved.Sent 16: ''It would really offset the current cuts,'' he said.",

We also can agree that older Oklahomans - like all citizens - have rights to control their health care until they become incapacitated or these rights are transferred to another by legal document or process.Sent 10: \"Old\" is not a legal classification that results in automatic loss of these rights.Sent 11: Moreover, having an old parent does not automatically confer on children the right to make the parents' health care choices.Sent 12: It follows that an important role lawyers provide for aging Oklahomans is not only to create rights - transferring documents such as durable powers of attorney and guardianship orders, but also to monitor their use.Sent 13: In family situations, for example, lawyers must ensure that powers of attorney and guardianships are used to serve only the person transferring or losing rights.Sent 14: They are not to be used to help a family \"manage\" their mother or help a doctor or nursing home get permission for a pill or procedure they feel is in the best interest of a patient.Sent 15: Good news: Oklahoma now has a Public Guardianship Program, albeit unfunded, that will supply lawyers to perform this rights-monitoring process Oklahoma grandparents should be able to enjoy their grandchildren, not raise them.Sent 16: But owing to the social problems of divorce and drug use, grandparents are increasingly being called on to raise their grandchildren because of missing parents.Sent 17: Adding to the physical, emotional and financial burden they take on, grandparents face legal problems.Sent 18: All the decisions parents made without a second thought now require evidence of legal authority when made by grandparents.",

[and] he called for resistance to war.\"Sent 10: By signing the letter to Roosevelt he went against his pacifist principles.Sent 11: In 1954, a year before his death, Einstein said to his old friend, Linus Pauling, \"I made one great mistake in my life--when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some justification--the danger that the Germans would make them ...\"",

We also can agree that older Oklahomans - like all citizens - have rights to control their health care until they become incapacitated or these rights are transferred to another by legal document or process.Sent 10: \"Old\" is not a legal classification that results in automatic loss of these rights.Sent 11: Moreover, having an old parent does not automatically confer on children the right to make the parents' health care choices.Sent 12: It follows that an important role lawyers provide for aging Oklahomans is not only to create rights - transferring documents such as durable powers of attorney and guardianship orders, but also to monitor their use.Sent 13: In family situations, for example, lawyers must ensure that powers of attorney and guardianships are used to serve only the person transferring or losing rights.Sent 14: They are not to be used to help a family \"manage\" their mother or help a doctor or nursing home get permission for a pill or procedure they feel is in the best interest of a patient.Sent 15: Good news: Oklahoma now has a Public Guardianship Program, albeit unfunded, that will supply lawyers to perform this rights-monitoring process Oklahoma grandparents should be able to enjoy their grandchildren, not raise them.Sent 16: But owing to the social problems of divorce and drug use, grandparents are increasingly being called on to raise their grandchildren because of missing parents.Sent 17: Adding to the physical, emotional and financial burden they take on, grandparents face legal problems.Sent 18: All the decisions parents made without a second thought now require evidence of legal authority when made by grandparents.",

Casey, executive director of Schuylkill Women in Crisis, finds it disturbing that in most cases, the fine for violating a PFA is little more than the fine someone would get for cruelty and abuse toward an animal.Sent 9: \"In most of the counties surrounding Schuylkill County, the penalties given for indirect criminal contempt are much stiffer than those in Schuylkill County,\" Casey said.Sent 10: \"What kind of message are we sending those who repeatedly violate Protection From Abuse orders?Sent 11: That it's OK to abuse women in Schuylkill County, because you'll only get a slap on the wrist?\"Sent 12: Under state law, the minimum fine for contempt of a PFA is $100; the maximum fine is $1,000 and up to six months in jail.Sent 13: Like others who are familiar with how the county's legal system does and doesn't work for victims of domestic violence, Casey believes some changes are in order.Sent 14: Valerie West, a manager/attorney with Mid-Penn Legal Services, with offices in Pottsville and Reading, regularly handles domestic violence cases.Sent 15: She finds fault with the local requirement that a custody order must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed.Sent 16: West said she feels a custody order should be allowed to stand for the full term of the PFA - up to 18 months - as it does in many other counties in the state.Sent 17: \"It places an undue burden on the plaintiff, in terms of cost, finding legal representation and facing their abuser - not to mention a further burden on the system to provide those services,\" West said.Sent 18: \"It may be difficult for the parties to reach an agreement so soon after violence has occurred.",

Harrison II said.Sent 7: The judges were reluctant to raise those fees but eventually decided that supporting probono services was important enough \"and lawyers had a responsibility to contribute\" to the cause, Harrison said.Sent 8: Last year, the high court raised the base fee for active attorneys to $180 from $140.Sent 9: Lawyers in their first three years of practice or who are inactive pay $90, and retired lawyers pay nothing.Sent 10: Legislation circulated by the high court's lobbyist specifies that the hike would apply to attorneys \"paying full annual registration fees.\"Sent 11: In 2001, there were 57,392 active attorneys in Illinois and 74,311 on the full roll, according to the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission.Sent 12: The hike would raise roughly $2.4 million.Sent 13: Last year, interest on the trust fund totaled $4.5 million, but service and handling fees consumed $538,000 of that amount.Sent 14: This year's returns are projected to be anywhere between $700,000 and $1 million short of that mark, said Ruth Ann Schmitt, the executive director of Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois.Sent 15: Harrison said the fee hikes are designed only to counter the shortfall in interest income, not add to the total amount available.Sent 16: \"Our legal services are already stretched to the breaking point,\" Schmitt said.Sent 17: \"We have a tough time raising enough money to properly fund services that our clients need.\"Sent 18: Neither the Illinois State Bar Association nor The Chicago Bar Association has taken a stance on the proposed hikes.",

Fred Rooney of Bethlehem.Sent 13: After all, politics run in the Rooney family.Sent 14: His brother, state Rep. T.J. Rooney of Bethlehem, is a power in the state Legislature and the Democratic Party.Sent 15: But on a trip to Colombia when he was a junior at Moravian, the child of privilege saw human suffering, malnutrition and poverty the likes of which he had never imagined.Sent 16: ''I couldn't understand why we live this way and they live that way,'' Rooney recalled.Sent 17: ''It's been the guiding light of my life ever since.''Sent 18: After graduating in CUNY Law School's first class in 1986, he took a job with Lehigh Valley Legal Services.",

Casey, executive director of Schuylkill Women in Crisis, finds it disturbing that in most cases, the fine for violating a PFA is little more than the fine someone would get for cruelty and abuse toward an animal.Sent 9: \"In most of the counties surrounding Schuylkill County, the penalties given for indirect criminal contempt are much stiffer than those in Schuylkill County,\" Casey said.Sent 10: \"What kind of message are we sending those who repeatedly violate Protection From Abuse orders?Sent 11: That it's OK to abuse women in Schuylkill County, because you'll only get a slap on the wrist?\"Sent 12: Under state law, the minimum fine for contempt of a PFA is $100; the maximum fine is $1,000 and up to six months in jail.Sent 13: Like others who are familiar with how the county's legal system does and doesn't work for victims of domestic violence, Casey believes some changes are in order.Sent 14: Valerie West, a manager/attorney with Mid-Penn Legal Services, with offices in Pottsville and Reading, regularly handles domestic violence cases.Sent 15: She finds fault with the local requirement that a custody order must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed.Sent 16: West said she feels a custody order should be allowed to stand for the full term of the PFA - up to 18 months - as it does in many other counties in the state.Sent 17: \"It places an undue burden on the plaintiff, in terms of cost, finding legal representation and facing their abuser - not to mention a further burden on the system to provide those services,\" West said.Sent 18: \"It may be difficult for the parties to reach an agreement so soon after violence has occurred.",

Billy Graham.Sent 8: More than 78,000 people have fled South Kordofan and Blue Nile states since August of last year after an armed rebellion took root, the United Nations reported.Sent 9: The Sudanese government is thought to have responded to the rebellion by conducting sustained air raids with the use of Russian-made Antonov bombers, which have raised concerns over civilian casualties.Sent 10: Decades of civil war between the north and south, costing as many as 2 million lives, formally ended with a U.S.-brokered peace treaty in 2005.",

Mark Bailey didn't dream of becoming a judge.Sent 2: Even when he graduated from North Decatur High School in 1975, sitting on the bench someday seemed more like a leisurely activity than a career.Sent 3: Somewhere along the line, all of that changed.Sent 4: Bailey received his bachelor's degree from the University of Indianapolis in 1978 and a jurisprudence doctorate from Indiana University-Indianapolis in 1982.Sent 5: After several years of private practice from 1982-90, he became the judge of Decatur County Court for a year.Sent 6: The Indiana legislature renamed that judgeship and Bailey was tabbed Decatur Superior Court judge from 1992-98, winning reelection twice.Sent 7: From there, his career continued on the fast track and Bailey was appointed by Gov. Frank O'Bannon to sit on the Indiana Court of Appeals First District, where he works today.Sent 8: Despite his quick climb up the legal ladder, Bailey has always found time to help out in causes he feels strongly about.Sent 9: It was for his dedication to the law and the people that are affected by it that he was recently recognized.Sent 10: The Indiana Pro Bono Commission hosted its annual celebration event, the Randall T. Shepard Dinner, at French Lick Springs Spa in October.Sent 11: More than 100 judges, lawyers and dignitaries were present for the gathering.Sent 12: One of the highlights of the event was the presentation of the first-ever Randall T. Shepard award for excellence in pro bono work.Sent 13: Bailey received the award for his three years of volunteer work at Indiana Pro Bono Commission.Sent 14: The award was named after the chief justice of the Indiana Supreme Court to honor his statewide vision on justice.Sent 15: The qualifications for the award were based upon demonstrated dedication to the innovative development and delivery of legal services to the poor in one of the 14 pro bono districts of Indiana.Sent 16: \"This award came as a real surprise to me.Sent 17: It is truly an honor.Sent 18: Just being the first chair of the commission which began the implementation of the pro bono process was somewhat humbling.",

Now, largely because of the troubled state of the world as a whole, civil liberties have disappeared in many other countries.\nIt is impossible, of course, to be at war and keep freedom of the press and freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. They disappear automatically. And so in many countries where ordinarily they were safe, today they have gone. In other countries, even before war came, not only freedom of the press and freedom of assembly, and freedom of speech disappeared, but freedom of religion disappeared.\nAnd so we know here in this country, we have a grave responsibility. We are at peace. We have no reason for the fears which govern so many other peoples throughout the world; therefore, we have to guard the freedoms of democracy.\n—Eleanor Roosevelt, Address to the American Civil Liberties Union, Chicago, Illinois, March 14, 1940\nRoosevelt's concerns can most directly be compared to those of the people who debated which of the following?",

General Assembly in New York last month, the spotlight was once again on Iran.Sent 2: And true to form, the Iranian president made his fair share of provocative statements for the Western media.Sent 3: But while Ahmadinejad's mercurial rants captured our media's attention, back in Iran a coordinated strategy against the women's movement continued.Sent 4: On the eve of Ahmadinejad's arrival to New York, Shiva Nazar Ahari, a prominent young female defender of human rights, received a heavy sentence of six years in prison on charges including the vague crime of \"waging war against God\" -- a convenient catch-all offense for anyone who criticizes the regime and its human rights record.Sent 5: There's no denying it -- Iran's women have had a bad year.Sent 6: Nazar Ahari joins a steadily increasing number of other women's rights activists who are in prison for no greater crime than their attempt to fight for the rights of the women.Sent 7: Hengameh Shahidi, Alieh Eghdam Doust, Bahareh Hedayat and Mahdiyeh Golrou have all been sent to Tehran's notorious Evin Prison on trumped-up charges related to their activism.Sent 8: And while Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, arguably the most internationally recognized Iranian women's rights activist, remains unable to safely return to her country, the government is targeting those affiliated with her for arrest and imprisonment, including her lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and her former aide Jinous Sobhani.Sent 9: Since the 2009 disputed elections and associated government crackdown on the overall reform movement, the government has increasingly targeted women activists.Sent 10: The reasons behind this go well beyond the misogynist nature of Iran's religious leadership.Sent 11: Rather, it is more part of a deliberate and calculated strategy of the Iranian authorities to strike at the heart of the regime's greatest vulnerability -- internal legitimacy with its own people.Sent 12: See more CNN.com opinion articles Iran's government recognizes and fears the broader power of the women activists who have been on the front line of reform in Iran for more than a decade.Sent 13: One can roughly draw an analogy between the women's movement in Iran to movements of religious groups in Burma or Tibet, or the labor \"solidarity\" movements in the former Eastern bloc and associated labor-Roman Catholic solidarity in Poland -- all advocating initially for the freedoms of a specific group but which provoked government fears for their transformative power to promote broader human rights progress.Sent 14: While the outside world occasionally reacts to the most egregious manifestations of Iran's repression of women -- such as the international condemnation associated with Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian widow sentenced to stoning on charges of alleged adultery -- these events are often portrayed simply as a consequence of the regime's archaic viewpoint about gender.",

His vast body of work includes engravings, his preferred technique in his later prints, altarpieces, portraits and self-portraits, watercolours and books.Sent 4: The woodcuts, such as the Apocalypse series (1498), retain a more Gothic flavour than the rest of his work.Sent 5: His well-known engravings include the Knight, Death, and the Devil (1513), Saint Jerome in his Study (1514) and Melencolia I (1514), which has been the subject of extensive analysis and interpretation.Sent 6: His watercolours also mark him as one of the first European landscape artists, while his ambitious woodcuts revolutionized the potential of that medium.Sent 7: Durer's introduction of classical motifs into Northern art, through his knowledge of Italian artists and German humanists, has secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the Northern Renaissance.Sent 8: This is reinforced by his theoretical treatises, which involve principles of mathematics, perspective and ideal proportions.",

Crown Prince Abdullah told President Clinton and Vice President Gore about this when he visited Washington in late September.Sent 10: His account confirmed reports that the U.S. government had received independently.Sent 11: Other efforts with the Saudi government centered on improving intelligence sharing and permitting U.S. agents to interrogate prisoners in Saudi custody.Sent 12: The history of such cooperation in 1997 and 1998 had been strained.Sent 13: Several officials told us, in particular, that the United States could not get direct access to an important al Qaeda financial official, Madani al Tayyib, who had been detained by the Saudi government in 1997.67Though U.S. officials repeatedly raised the issue, the Saudis provided limited information.Sent 14: In his September 1998 meeting with Crown Prince Abdullah, Vice President Gore, while thanking the Saudi government for their responsiveness, renewed the request for direct U.S. access to Tayyib.Sent 15: The United States never obtained this access.Sent 16: An NSC staff-led working group on terrorist finances asked the CIA in November 1998 to push again for access to Tayyib and to see \"if it is possible to elaborate further on the ties between Usama bin Ladin and prominent individuals in Saudi Arabia, including especially the Bin Laden family.\"Sent 17: One result was two NSC-led interagency trips to Persian Gulf states in 1999 and 2000.Sent 18: During these trips the NSC, Treasury, and intelligence representatives spoke with Saudi officials, and later interviewed members of the Bin Laden family, about Usama's inheritance.",

(LSC), a quasi-governmental agency that provides legal aid for the poor, would receive $329 million in fiscal 2004 under President Bush's proposal - the same amount requested in 2003 and approved for 2002 and 2001.Sent 2: If approved, the hold-the-line request for LSC means its budget would erode with inflation for another year, but it could be worse for the organization: Many conservatives fought for years to do away with the LSC altogether, saying legal services attorneys were spending too much time fighting for liberal causes or pursuing politically charged cases against the government instead of representing the needy.Sent 3: Opposition to the organization has cooled since 1996, when Congress approved restrictions (PL 104-134) on the sorts of cases federally funded legal aid attorneys can take.Sent 4: (1996 Almanac, p.Sent 5: 5-36) Republicans cut the organization's budget deeply in 1996, but its funding has recovered slowly.Sent 6: Last month, in the omnibus spending bill for fiscal 2003, the Senate added a onetime increase of $19 million, which, if approved in the final version, would bring the LSC budget to $348 million.Sent 7: The money would go to help states, such as Michigan and Ohio, that lost money when the organization redistributed its funding based on census counts made in 2000 of poor households.Sent 8: If the extra money survives a conference with the House and makes it to the president's desk, LSC supporters may try to include it in the organization's fiscal 2004 funding.Sent 9: The federal government began funding some programs to provide legal assistance to the poor in the late 1960s; the Legal Services Corporation was created in 1974 (PL 93-355).Sent 10: LSC gives nearly all its money to state and local agencies, which provide civil legal assistance to those whose income is less than 125 percent of the federal poverty level - $11,075 a year for an individual and $22,625 for a family of four.Sent 11: Funding for legal services goes to defend needy clients in domestic violence cases, custody cases and other such matters, according to LSC.Sent 12: Since 1996, lawyers who receive money from Legal Services have been prohibited from such activities as lobbying legislatures, filing class-action suits, participating in political demonstrations or strikes, pursuing abortion-related litigation, representing illegal aliens or prisoners, or defending public housing tenants evicted because they were charged with selling drugs",

No, we refuse to be beaten! One feature of the history of old Russia was the continual beatings she suffered because of her backwardness. She was beaten by the Mongol khans. She was beaten by the Turkish beys. She was beaten by the Swedish feudal lords. She was beaten by the Polish and Lithuanian gentry. She was beaten by the British and French capitalists. She was beaten by the Japanese barons. All beat her––because of her backwardness, because of her military backwardness, cultural backwardness, political backwardness, industrial backwardness, agricultural backwardness. They beat her because it was profitable and could be done with impunity. You remember the words of the pre-revolutionary poet: \"You are poor and abundant, mighty and impotent, Mother Russia.\" Those gentlemen were quite familiar with the verses of the old poet. They beat her, saying: \"You are abundant,\" so one can enrich oneself at your expense. They beat her, saying: \"You are poor and impotent,\" so you can be beaten and plundered with impunity. Such is the law of the exploiters––to beat the backward and the weak. It is the jungle law of capitalism. You are backward, you are weak––therefore you are wrong; hence you can be beaten and enslaved. You are mighty––therefore you are right; hence we must be wary of you.\nThat is why we must no longer lag behind.\"\nJoseph Stalin, speech delivered at the first All-Union Conference of Leading Personnel of Socialist Industry, February 4, 1931\nThe reference to the \"continual beatings\" most directly supports which of the following decisions in later Soviet foreign policy?",
