    "question": "A farmer owned a piece of land on which he grew strawberries. Over the years, the farmer had earned a reputation for growing strawberries that were extremely sweet and juicy. For that reason, consumers always looked forward to strawberry season, when the farmer's strawberries would be available. Hoping to capitalize on the farmer's reputation, a produce retailer who operated three stores in the area contacted the farmer about the possibility of carrying the farmer's strawberries in his stores. After lengthy negotiations, the parties executed the following written agreement:\"The farmer will supply the retailer with all of its needs of strawberries from April through July each year for the next three years. The retailer will pay $5. 00 per bushel of strawberries delivered. \"On April 1 of the first year of the contract, the retailer submitted an order for 75 bushels of strawberries. Upon receiving the order, the farmer sent the retailer the following fax:\"Your order was way more than I anticipated. If! sent you that many strawberries I would not have enough for my other customers. I can send you 50 bushels, but no more. \"The retailer then notified the farmer that if he did not deliver all 75 bushels, the retailer would sue him for breach of contract.

John Tanner announced Monday that the grant was awarded to West Tennessee Legal Services of Jackson.Sent 4: The organization provides legal assistance and advocacy in 17 counties.Sent 5: \"This award will offer assistance as we look for whatever ways possible to stop domestic violence and help the women, men and children who are victims of abuse,\" Tanner said in a news statement.Sent 6: The organization doesn't have a staff member who speaks Spanish and the need is increasing with growing Hispanic populations, said the organization's executive director Steven Xanthopoulos.Sent 7: He estimated the money will help handle at least another 180 cases next year.Sent 8: The group closes about 2,500 cases a year.Sent 9: The money was timed well because the legal group had recently lost about $120,000 in grant money due to a decrease in the poverty population in West Tennessee in Census 2000, Xanthopoulos said.Sent 10: \"The drop in poverty is a good thing, but there is still a great need out there,\" he said.Sent 11: \"So this was a very good thing.\"Sent 12: Having legal representation at divorce and child custody hearings is important in helping victims leave abusive and sometimes dangerous situations, said Margaret Cole, executive director of Wo/Men's Resource and Rape Assistance Program in Jackson.Sent 13: Her organization and Northwest Safeline are partners in the grant.Sent 14: Northwest Safeline, based in Dyersburg, is a family violence intervention project that serves Dyer, Obion, Lake and Crockett counties.",

[and] he called for resistance to war.\"Sent 10: By signing the letter to Roosevelt he went against his pacifist principles.Sent 11: In 1954, a year before his death, Einstein said to his old friend, Linus Pauling, \"I made one great mistake in my life--when I signed the letter to President Roosevelt recommending that atom bombs be made; but there was some justification--the danger that the Germans would make them ...\"",

Billy Graham.Sent 8: More than 78,000 people have fled South Kordofan and Blue Nile states since August of last year after an armed rebellion took root, the United Nations reported.Sent 9: The Sudanese government is thought to have responded to the rebellion by conducting sustained air raids with the use of Russian-made Antonov bombers, which have raised concerns over civilian casualties.Sent 10: Decades of civil war between the north and south, costing as many as 2 million lives, formally ended with a U.S.-brokered peace treaty in 2005.",

Mark Bailey didn't dream of becoming a judge.Sent 2: Even when he graduated from North Decatur High School in 1975, sitting on the bench someday seemed more like a leisurely activity than a career.Sent 3: Somewhere along the line, all of that changed.Sent 4: Bailey received his bachelor's degree from the University of Indianapolis in 1978 and a jurisprudence doctorate from Indiana University-Indianapolis in 1982.Sent 5: After several years of private practice from 1982-90, he became the judge of Decatur County Court for a year.Sent 6: The Indiana legislature renamed that judgeship and Bailey was tabbed Decatur Superior Court judge from 1992-98, winning reelection twice.Sent 7: From there, his career continued on the fast track and Bailey was appointed by Gov. Frank O'Bannon to sit on the Indiana Court of Appeals First District, where he works today.Sent 8: Despite his quick climb up the legal ladder, Bailey has always found time to help out in causes he feels strongly about.Sent 9: It was for his dedication to the law and the people that are affected by it that he was recently recognized.Sent 10: The Indiana Pro Bono Commission hosted its annual celebration event, the Randall T. Shepard Dinner, at French Lick Springs Spa in October.Sent 11: More than 100 judges, lawyers and dignitaries were present for the gathering.Sent 12: One of the highlights of the event was the presentation of the first-ever Randall T. Shepard award for excellence in pro bono work.Sent 13: Bailey received the award for his three years of volunteer work at Indiana Pro Bono Commission.Sent 14: The award was named after the chief justice of the Indiana Supreme Court to honor his statewide vision on justice.Sent 15: The qualifications for the award were based upon demonstrated dedication to the innovative development and delivery of legal services to the poor in one of the 14 pro bono districts of Indiana.Sent 16: \"This award came as a real surprise to me.Sent 17: It is truly an honor.Sent 18: Just being the first chair of the commission which began the implementation of the pro bono process was somewhat humbling.",

(LSC), a quasi-governmental agency that provides legal aid for the poor, would receive $329 million in fiscal 2004 under President Bush's proposal - the same amount requested in 2003 and approved for 2002 and 2001.Sent 2: If approved, the hold-the-line request for LSC means its budget would erode with inflation for another year, but it could be worse for the organization: Many conservatives fought for years to do away with the LSC altogether, saying legal services attorneys were spending too much time fighting for liberal causes or pursuing politically charged cases against the government instead of representing the needy.Sent 3: Opposition to the organization has cooled since 1996, when Congress approved restrictions (PL 104-134) on the sorts of cases federally funded legal aid attorneys can take.Sent 4: (1996 Almanac, p.Sent 5: 5-36) Republicans cut the organization's budget deeply in 1996, but its funding has recovered slowly.Sent 6: Last month, in the omnibus spending bill for fiscal 2003, the Senate added a onetime increase of $19 million, which, if approved in the final version, would bring the LSC budget to $348 million.Sent 7: The money would go to help states, such as Michigan and Ohio, that lost money when the organization redistributed its funding based on census counts made in 2000 of poor households.Sent 8: If the extra money survives a conference with the House and makes it to the president's desk, LSC supporters may try to include it in the organization's fiscal 2004 funding.Sent 9: The federal government began funding some programs to provide legal assistance to the poor in the late 1960s; the Legal Services Corporation was created in 1974 (PL 93-355).Sent 10: LSC gives nearly all its money to state and local agencies, which provide civil legal assistance to those whose income is less than 125 percent of the federal poverty level - $11,075 a year for an individual and $22,625 for a family of four.Sent 11: Funding for legal services goes to defend needy clients in domestic violence cases, custody cases and other such matters, according to LSC.Sent 12: Since 1996, lawyers who receive money from Legal Services have been prohibited from such activities as lobbying legislatures, filing class-action suits, participating in political demonstrations or strikes, pursuing abortion-related litigation, representing illegal aliens or prisoners, or defending public housing tenants evicted because they were charged with selling drugs",

Sent 8: Some weeks had since passed; and it was understood in the neighbourhood that Margaret had gone to London, when she suddenly appeared driving out with Geoffrey Brent, and the entire neighbourhood knew before nightfall that she had taken up her abode at the Rock.

    "passage_text": "Sent 1: Albert Bandura OC (/baen'dU@r@/; born December 4, 1925) is a psychologist who is the David Starr Jordan Professor Emeritus of Social Science in Psychology at Stanford University.Sent 2: For almost six decades, he has been responsible for contributions to the field of education and to many fields of psychology, including social cognitive theory, therapy and personality psychology, and was also influential in the transition between behaviorism and cognitive psychology.Sent 3: He is known as the originator of social learning theory and the theoretical construct of self-efficacy, and is also responsible for the influential 1961 Bobo doll experiment.Sent 4: Social learning theory is how people learn through observing others.Sent 5: An example of social learning theory would be the students imitating the teacher.Sent 6: Self-efficacy is \"The belief in one's capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to manage prospective situations.\"Sent 7: To paraphrase, self-efficiacy is believing in yourself to take action.Sent 8: The Bobo Doll Experiment was how Albert Bandura studied aggression and non-aggression in children.Sent 9: A 2002 survey ranked Bandura as the fourth most-frequently cited psychologist of all time, behind B. F. Skinner, Sigmund Freud, and Jean Piaget, and as the most cited living one.Sent 10: Bandura is widely described as the greatest living psychologist, and as one of the most influential psychologists of all time.Sent 11: In 1974 Bandura was elected to be the Eighty-Second President of the American Psychological Association (APA).Sent 12: He was one of the youngest president-elects in the history of the APA at the age of 48.Sent 13: Bandura served as a member of the APA Board of Scientific Affairs from 1968 to 1970 and is well known as a member of the editorial board of nine psychology journals including the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology from 1963 to 1972.Sent 14: At the age of 82, Bandura was awarded the Grawemeyer Award for psychology.",

We also can agree that older Oklahomans - like all citizens - have rights to control their health care until they become incapacitated or these rights are transferred to another by legal document or process.Sent 10: \"Old\" is not a legal classification that results in automatic loss of these rights.Sent 11: Moreover, having an old parent does not automatically confer on children the right to make the parents' health care choices.Sent 12: It follows that an important role lawyers provide for aging Oklahomans is not only to create rights - transferring documents such as durable powers of attorney and guardianship orders, but also to monitor their use.Sent 13: In family situations, for example, lawyers must ensure that powers of attorney and guardianships are used to serve only the person transferring or losing rights.Sent 14: They are not to be used to help a family \"manage\" their mother or help a doctor or nursing home get permission for a pill or procedure they feel is in the best interest of a patient.Sent 15: Good news: Oklahoma now has a Public Guardianship Program, albeit unfunded, that will supply lawyers to perform this rights-monitoring process Oklahoma grandparents should be able to enjoy their grandchildren, not raise them.Sent 16: But owing to the social problems of divorce and drug use, grandparents are increasingly being called on to raise their grandchildren because of missing parents.Sent 17: Adding to the physical, emotional and financial burden they take on, grandparents face legal problems.Sent 18: All the decisions parents made without a second thought now require evidence of legal authority when made by grandparents.",

Casey, executive director of Schuylkill Women in Crisis, finds it disturbing that in most cases, the fine for violating a PFA is little more than the fine someone would get for cruelty and abuse toward an animal.Sent 9: \"In most of the counties surrounding Schuylkill County, the penalties given for indirect criminal contempt are much stiffer than those in Schuylkill County,\" Casey said.Sent 10: \"What kind of message are we sending those who repeatedly violate Protection From Abuse orders?Sent 11: That it's OK to abuse women in Schuylkill County, because you'll only get a slap on the wrist?\"Sent 12: Under state law, the minimum fine for contempt of a PFA is $100; the maximum fine is $1,000 and up to six months in jail.Sent 13: Like others who are familiar with how the county's legal system does and doesn't work for victims of domestic violence, Casey believes some changes are in order.Sent 14: Valerie West, a manager/attorney with Mid-Penn Legal Services, with offices in Pottsville and Reading, regularly handles domestic violence cases.Sent 15: She finds fault with the local requirement that a custody order must be established within 30 days after a PFA is filed.Sent 16: West said she feels a custody order should be allowed to stand for the full term of the PFA - up to 18 months - as it does in many other counties in the state.Sent 17: \"It places an undue burden on the plaintiff, in terms of cost, finding legal representation and facing their abuser - not to mention a further burden on the system to provide those services,\" West said.Sent 18: \"It may be difficult for the parties to reach an agreement so soon after violence has occurred.",

B.\" Buzzy\" Krongard, had said that either one of them would be happy to pull the trigger, but Tenet was appalled, telling them that they had no authority to do it, nor did he.Sent 12: Third, the Hellfire warhead carried by the Predator needed work.Sent 13: It had been built to hit tanks, not people.Sent 14: It needed to be designed to explode in a different way, and even then had to be targeted with extreme precision.Sent 15: In the configuration planned by the Air Force through mid-2001, the Predator's missile would not be able to hit a moving vehicle.Sent 16: White House officials had seen the Predator video of the \"man in white.\"Sent 17: On July 11, Hadley tried to hurry along preparation of the armed system.Sent 18: He directed McLaughlin, Wolfowitz, and Joint Chiefs Vice Chairman Richard Myers to deploy Predators capable of being armed no later than September 1.",

Sent 3: She had read and reread them--cullings from Chaucer, from Spenser, from the Elizabethan lyrists, the border balladry, fierce, tender, oh, so human--till she knew pages of them by heart, and their vocabulary influenced her own, their imagery tinged all her leisure thoughts. Sent 4: It seemed to her, whenever she debated returning them, that she could not bear it. Sent 5: She would get them out and sit with one of them open in her hands, not reading, but staring at the pages with unseeing eyes, passing her fingers over it, as one strokes a beloved hand, or turning through each book only to find the pencilled words in the margins. Sent 6: She would be giving up part of herself when she took these back. Sent 7: Yet it had to be done, and one miserable morning she made them all into a neat package, intending to carry them to the mill and place them on Stoddard's desk thus early, when nobody would be in the office.

Robert Menendez.Sent 2: With yellow crime tape strung up outside, men and women lugged box after box of materials from Melgen's West Palm Beach office into awaiting minivans.Sent 3: Both members of the federal Health and Human Services department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation took part in the search, which FBI Special Agent Michael Leverock said was the second at the same Melgen clinic -- the other coming last January.Sent 4: \"As this is part of an ongoing investigation, (authorities have) no further comment/information at this time,\" said Leverock.Sent 5: That means no official details as to what authorities were looking for.Sent 6: Even if it has nothing to do with his record as a generous political donor, Tuesday's raid suggests Melgen's legal troubles and perhaps their negative impact on Menendez, the senior U.S. senator from New Jersey are far from over.Sent 7: Confessions show sex claims were 'false smears,' senator says The doctor's lawyer contended that Tuesday's search was the government's way of getting back at Melgen, after he sued over Medicare payments.Sent 8: Even so, Matthew Menchel, the attorney, said that Melgen will continue to work with authorities.Sent 9: \"While we believe that today's intrusion was in retaliation and there was no legitimate need for the search, the FBI's actions will not prevent Dr. Melgen from continuing his full cooperation with the government,\" Menchel said.Sent 10: The doctor first came to the attention of many around Washington when The Daily Caller, a conservative website, published a report shortly before the November 2012 election citing several Dominican women who claimed they'd had sex with Menendez for money.Sent 11: The New Jersey Democrat staunchly denied the accusation.Sent 12: And in March, Dominican police announced three women had been paid to claim -- falsely -- that they had sex with Menendez.Sent 13: While that part of the story died down, the episode raised questions about why and how Menendez admittedly flew to the Dominican Republic three times in 2010 on Melgen's private plane.",

Rick Perry.Sent 4: The law says that at least 24 hours before an abortion is performed, women must undergo a sonogram, a procedure that uses ultrasound to create an image.Sent 5: The doctor, then, is required to give, \"in a manner understandable to a layperson, a verbal explanation of the results of the sonogram images, including a medical description of the dimensions of the embryo or fetus, the presence of cardiac activity, and the presence of external members and internal organs,\" the law states.Sent 6: There are some exceptions, including pregnancies that resulted from sexual assault, incest or other violations of law.Sent 7: Women seeking abortions also are exempt if the fetus has been found to have an irreversible medical condition that will cause a disability.Sent 8: \"Governor Perry was pleased to sign this important legislation, which bolsters our efforts to protect life by ensuring Texans are fully informed when considering such an important decision,\" said his deputy press secretary, Lucy Nashed.Sent 9: Critics say the new law is unnecessary.Sent 10: \"What no one is focusing on is that this is a mandate to humiliate women who want an abortion,\" said Yvonne Gutierrez, vice president for public affairs at the Planned Parenthood Trust of South Texas.Sent 11: Texas already requires a 24-hour consent period, and the new law will simply add emotional and financial costs to those seeking abortions, she said.",

Billy Graham.Sent 8: More than 78,000 people have fled South Kordofan and Blue Nile states since August of last year after an armed rebellion took root, the United Nations reported.Sent 9: The Sudanese government is thought to have responded to the rebellion by conducting sustained air raids with the use of Russian-made Antonov bombers, which have raised concerns over civilian casualties.Sent 10: Decades of civil war between the north and south, costing as many as 2 million lives, formally ended with a U.S.-brokered peace treaty in 2005.",
