Sent 2: I never turn back, though often so inclined, and in this particular instance, amid such surroundings, everything seemed singularly unfavorable for the calm acceptance of so grim a company. Sent 3: Suppressing my fears, I soon discovered that although as hairy as bears and as crooked as summit pines, the strange creatures were sufficiently erect to belong to our own species. Sent 4: They proved to be nothing more formidable than Mono Indians dressed in the skins of sage-rabbits. Sent 5: Both the men and the women begged persistently for whisky and tobacco, and seemed so accustomed to denials that I found it impossible to convince them that I had none to give. Sent 6: Excepting the names of these two products of civilization, they seemed to understand not a word of English; but I afterward learned that they were on their way to Yosemite Valley to feast awhile on trout and procure a load of acorns to carry back through the pass to their huts on the shore of Mono Lake.",

Fred Rooney of Bethlehem.Sent 13: After all, politics run in the Rooney family.Sent 14: His brother, state Rep. T.J. Rooney of Bethlehem, is a power in the state Legislature and the Democratic Party.Sent 15: But on a trip to Colombia when he was a junior at Moravian, the child of privilege saw human suffering, malnutrition and poverty the likes of which he had never imagined.Sent 16: ''I couldn't understand why we live this way and they live that way,'' Rooney recalled.Sent 17: ''It's been the guiding light of my life ever since.''Sent 18: After graduating in CUNY Law School's first class in 1986, he took a job with Lehigh Valley Legal Services.",

We also can agree that older Oklahomans - like all citizens - have rights to control their health care until they become incapacitated or these rights are transferred to another by legal document or process.Sent 10: \"Old\" is not a legal classification that results in automatic loss of these rights.Sent 11: Moreover, having an old parent does not automatically confer on children the right to make the parents' health care choices.Sent 12: It follows that an important role lawyers provide for aging Oklahomans is not only to create rights - transferring documents such as durable powers of attorney and guardianship orders, but also to monitor their use.Sent 13: In family situations, for example, lawyers must ensure that powers of attorney and guardianships are used to serve only the person transferring or losing rights.Sent 14: They are not to be used to help a family \"manage\" their mother or help a doctor or nursing home get permission for a pill or procedure they feel is in the best interest of a patient.Sent 15: Good news: Oklahoma now has a Public Guardianship Program, albeit unfunded, that will supply lawyers to perform this rights-monitoring process Oklahoma grandparents should be able to enjoy their grandchildren, not raise them.Sent 16: But owing to the social problems of divorce and drug use, grandparents are increasingly being called on to raise their grandchildren because of missing parents.Sent 17: Adding to the physical, emotional and financial burden they take on, grandparents face legal problems.Sent 18: All the decisions parents made without a second thought now require evidence of legal authority when made by grandparents.",

Heiby of the University of Hawaii, who chairs a committee of the 1,000-member American Association of Applied and Preventive Psychology that is concerned about the medicalization of psychology.Sent 6: \"Making sure that practicing psychologists are giving patients interventions based on the best available psychological science should be the APA's priority,\" argues Emory University's Scott Lilienfeld, president of the Society for a Science of Clinical Psychology (SSCP).Sent 7: More than any philosophical betrayal of psychology, RxP opponents fear that the movement will undermine the science they love.Sent 8: They believe that if prescriptive authority becomes the norm, biomedical requirements will inevitably seep into the psychology curriculum, at the expense of traditional psychological science and methodology.Sent 9: Lilienfeld feels that many clinical psychologists already receive inadequate training in fundamentals such as research design and evaluation.Sent 10: RxP opponents charge the APA with pushing its prescription-privileges agenda without adequately assessing support for it in the field.Sent 11: The 300-member SSCP is the only group within the APA to have taken a formal stance against prescription privileges.Sent 12: The APA has scheduled 30 minutes at its meeting in August for an RxP debate, but its leadership believes it already has an accurate sense of support for its RxP policy.Sent 13: \"Except for this small vocal minority, we have just not gotten a lot of groundswell against this from members,\" says APA president Philip G. Zimbardo of Stanford University.Sent 14: With prescription privileges now a reality in one state, some RxP opponents concede that it may be too late.Sent 15: This year four states besides New Mexico -- Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois and Tennessee -- have pending legislation for psychologist prescription privileges.Sent 16: Over the past decade, 14 state legislatures have considered such laws.Sent 17: Between 1991 and 1997, a U.S. Department of Defense psychopharmacology demonstration project involving two to four years' training produced 10 military psychologists who can write prescriptions.",

Robert Menendez.Sent 2: With yellow crime tape strung up outside, men and women lugged box after box of materials from Melgen's West Palm Beach office into awaiting minivans.Sent 3: Both members of the federal Health and Human Services department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation took part in the search, which FBI Special Agent Michael Leverock said was the second at the same Melgen clinic -- the other coming last January.Sent 4: \"As this is part of an ongoing investigation, (authorities have) no further comment/information at this time,\" said Leverock.Sent 5: That means no official details as to what authorities were looking for.Sent 6: Even if it has nothing to do with his record as a generous political donor, Tuesday's raid suggests Melgen's legal troubles and perhaps their negative impact on Menendez, the senior U.S. senator from New Jersey are far from over.Sent 7: Confessions show sex claims were 'false smears,' senator says The doctor's lawyer contended that Tuesday's search was the government's way of getting back at Melgen, after he sued over Medicare payments.Sent 8: Even so, Matthew Menchel, the attorney, said that Melgen will continue to work with authorities.Sent 9: \"While we believe that today's intrusion was in retaliation and there was no legitimate need for the search, the FBI's actions will not prevent Dr. Melgen from continuing his full cooperation with the government,\" Menchel said.Sent 10: The doctor first came to the attention of many around Washington when The Daily Caller, a conservative website, published a report shortly before the November 2012 election citing several Dominican women who claimed they'd had sex with Menendez for money.Sent 11: The New Jersey Democrat staunchly denied the accusation.Sent 12: And in March, Dominican police announced three women had been paid to claim -- falsely -- that they had sex with Menendez.Sent 13: While that part of the story died down, the episode raised questions about why and how Menendez admittedly flew to the Dominican Republic three times in 2010 on Melgen's private plane.",
